Individuals with subtotal complement C6 deficiency possess a C6 molecule that is 14% shorter than normal C6 and present in low but detectable concentrations (1-2% of the normal mean). We now show that this dysmorphic C6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the pUEX expression system. We thus predicted that the abnormal C6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14% from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence. By sequencing PCR-amplified products from this region, we found, in three individuals from two families, a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the defect. All three have an abnormal 5 splice donor site of intron 15, which would probably prevent splicing.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: no strict genotype-phenotype correlations but clustering of missense mutations in the amino-terminal part of the WASP gene product. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) gene was found to be mutated in patients presenting with WAS and in patients showing X-linked thrombocytopenia. Mutation analysis in 19 families of German, Swiss and Turkish descent by single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing resulted in the detection of seven novel and 10 known mutations. A striking clustering of missense mutations in the first four exons contrasted with a random distribution of nonsense mutations. More than 85% of all known missense mutations were localized in the amino-terminal stretch of the WASP gene product; this region contained a mutational hot spot at codon 86.

Peripherally, the scotopic sensitivities were normal, as was the recovery from bleach. Cone electroretinograms were diminished in amplitude, and delayed in all affected adults except one. Rod electroretinograms were normal or near normal in amplitude, and had normal implicit times.

Transporter-facilitated uptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) has been implicated in anxiety in humans and animal models and is the site of action of widely used uptake-inhibiting antidepressant and antianxiety drugs. Human 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene transcription is modulated by a common polymorphism in its upstream regulatory region. The short variant of the polymorphism reduces the transcriptional efficiency of the 5-HTT gene promoter, resulting in decreased 5-HTT expression and 5-HT uptake in lymphoblasts. Association studies in two independent samples totaling 505 individuals revealed that the 5-HTT polymorphism accounts for 3 to 4 percent of total variation and 7 to 9 percent of inherited variance in anxiety-related personality traits in individuals as well as sibships..", "target": "<TAG> 14-37 ; 207-215 ; 841-876", "doc_id": "ncbi_8929413", "dataset": "ncbi"}

From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed. In rats, detection of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions. Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug-induced hypothermia. In mice, apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage. Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both. By contrast, apomorphine-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box.

The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy.

OBJECTIVES: Thrombotic microangiopathy is a well-known problem in patients following renal transplantation. In postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome. We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. RESULTS: Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up.

In this work, a polymer assembling strategy was used to make nanoparticles with exceptionally high loading of theranostic agent. As an example, poly(heptamethine) was synthesized via multicomponent Passerini reaction, and then assembled into nanoparticles in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol)2k-block-poly(d,l-lactide)2k (PEG-PLA) with high heptamethine loading (>50%).

Here, we report the cloning and functional studies of proline-rich AMPs (PR-AMPs) from the three species of mud crab: Scylla paramamosain, S. serrata, and the swimming crab Portunus pelagicus. The deduced peptides revealed that they contain the putative signal peptides and encode for mature peptides, which contain sequence architecture similar to a 6.5-kDa proline-rich AMP of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas which showed similarity with the bactenecin7. Tissue distribuction analysis indicated that the SpPR-AMP1 was expressed in a wide range of adult tissues, with the highest expression levels in the crab hemocyte.

Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans increases detection power, but haplotype -based methods require individual genotypes and are not applicable on pool-sequenced samples. We propose to take advantage of the local score approach to account for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection, cumulating (possibly small) signals from single markers over a genomic segment, to clearly pinpoint a selection signal. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this approach detects selection with higher power than several state-of-the-art single-marker, windowing or haplotype -based approaches. We illustrate this on two benchmark data sets including individual genotypes, for which we obtain similar results with the local score and one haplotype -based approach. Finally, we apply the local score approach to Pool-Seq data obtained from a divergent selection experiment on behaviour in quail and obtain precise and biologically coherent selection signals: while competing methods fail to highlight any clear selection signature, our method detects several regions involving genes known to act on social responsiveness or autistic traits.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Infectivity, effects on helper viruses and whitefly transmission of the deltasatellites associated with sweepoviruses (genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae) Begomoviruses (family Geminiviridae) are whitefly - transmitted viruses with single-stranded DNA genomes that are frequently associated with DNA satellites. These satellites include non-coding satellites, for which the name deltasatellites has been proposed. Although the first deltasatellite was identified in the late 1990s, little is known about the effects they have on infections of their helper begomoviruses. Recently a group of deltasatellites were identified associated with sweepoviruses, a group of phylogenetically distinct begomoviruses that infect plants of the family Convolvulaceae including sweet potato.

Although the mechanism underlying cessation of male signaling activity in the presence of disruption is not yet understood, results suggest that an 80 Hz vibrational signal should be tested in laboratory and field experiments to assess its efficacy in disrupting mating of GWSS.", "target": "<TAG> 8-14 ; 14-19 ; 19-30 ; 34-45 ; 50-57 ; 76-93 ; 133-141 ; 153-158 ; 158-168 ; 171-180 ; 183-192 ; 192-199 ; 199-207 ; 212-226 ; 226-234 ; 260-267 ; 267-294 ; 330-339 ; 339-349 ; 361-374 ; 391-406 ; 409-416 ; 427-438 ; 438-443 ; 443-453 ; 456-463 ; 463-479 ; 492-503 ; 503-520 ; 545-552 ; 552-568 ; 582-592 ; 603-613 ; 616-621 ; 621-631 ; 647-656 ; 659-670 ; 693-701 ; 723-742 ; 762-773 ; 777-795 ; 798-805 ; 809-818 ; 832-839 ; 842-847", "doc_id": "medmentions_28523722", "dataset": "medmentions"}

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Immunological effects of occupational exposure to lead (Review) It is well-known that occupational and environmental exposure to several factors, including benzene, heavy metals, chemicals and mineral fibers, is associated with the risk of developing a great number of diseases. Numerous studies have been carried out in order to investigate the mechanisms of toxicity of these substances, with particular regard to the possible toxic effects on the immune system. However, little is known about the influence of heavy metals, such as lead, on the immune system in human populations. Lead is a heavy metal still used in many industrial activities. Human exposure to lead can induce various biological effects depending upon the level and duration of exposure, such as toxic effects on haematological, cardiovascular, nervous and reproductive systems. Several studies demonstrated that exposure to lead is associated to toxic effects also on the immune system, thus increasing the incidence of allergy, infectious disease, autoimmunity or cancer.

The monkeys freely stood, unrestrained on a balance platform and made voluntary head turns between visual targets. To quantify each animals ' posture, motions of the head and trunk, as well as torque about the body's center of mass, were measured. In the mildly ablated animal, we observed less foretrunk sway in comparison with the normal state. When the canal prosthesis provided electric stimulation to the severely ablated animal, it showed a decrease in trunk sway during head turns. Because the rhesus monkey with severe bilateral vestibular loss exhibited a decrease in trunk sway when receiving vestibular prosthetic stimulation, we propose that the prosthetic electrical stimulation partially restored head velocity information.

Biphasic character was also demonstrated at the functional level via differing affinities on either side of the BJPNF for cell attachment.

As a result, it is often removed from solution by adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC), followed by incineration of the spent carbon. To provide a new approach for treatment, PFOA was exposed to sulfate radicals (SO4(-\u2022)) produced by thermolysis of persulfate (S2O8(2-)) in the presence of PAC. Under acidic conditions, thermal activation of persulfate resulted in transformation of PFOA to shorter-chain-length perfluorinated compounds, as previously reported. However, when thermolysis of persulfate occurred under circumneutral pH conditions in the presence of PAC, a new removal pathway for PFOA was observed.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Identification of mineral - binding peptides that discriminate between chalcopyrite and enargite Innovative approaches to the separation of minerals and subsequent extraction of metals are imperative owing to the increasing mineralogical complexity of ore deposits that are difficult or even impossible to separate into slurries or solutions containing only the minerals or metals of interest. Low recovery of metal is typical for these complex deposits leading to significant losses to tailings. In addition, the minerals often contain impurities, some toxic, which are difficult and costly to control or manage during the processing of a concentrate or other mineral product. One example of this complex situation is the significant economic and environmental costs associated with diluting and processing copper concentrates containing arsenic (in the form of the mineral enargite, Cu3 AsS4) in the production of pure copper. To overcome these separation problems, we have utilized phage display to identify peptides that demonstrate selective recognition of enargite and the arsenic - free copper sulfide, chalcopyrite.

In order to control the incorporation of these CNT channels into lipid bilayers, it is important to understand the structure of the CNTPs before and after insertion into the lipid bilayer as well as the impact of such insertion on the bilayer structure. Here we employed a noninvasive in situ probe, small-angle X-ray scattering, to study the integration of CNT porins into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers.

To circumvent the low bioavailability and the short half-life time obstacles, we hypothesized a novel PLGA nano-platform functionalized with CS and PEG to encapsulate these phytochemicals. This encapsulation will protect the compounds from the phagocytic uptake and deliver PLGA-CS-PEG nano-prototype with high biodegradability and biosafety.

The aim of this study was to determine a possible correlation between HPV type, protein expression and DNA content in both pre-invasive and invasive squamous cell carcinoma, as well as differences between studied groups in these parameters. Sections of formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from 54 cases of Morbus Bowen (preinvasive cutaneous carcinoma) and 41 cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin were subjected to HPV genotyping using Lipa (Line imuno probe assay), immunohistochemical staining for p16(INK4A), p53, pRb and prepared for flow cytometry DNA content analysis. Obtained data were analyzed in SPSS using Chi square test. Only p16 expression showed statistically significant differences in studied groups. Statistically significant correlations were found only in MB between parameters HPV - p53, p53 - pRb", "target": "<TAG> 18-32 ; 33-52 ; 56-68 ; 71-81 ; 81-94 ; 98-117 ; 123-132 ; 132-141 ; 156-177 ; 186-202 ; 202-216 ; 241-249 ; 252-256 ; 257-261 ; 265-269 ; 269-280 ; 283-304 ; 315-323 ; 326-330 ; 353-372 ; 376-390 ; 395-407 ; 471-483 ; 491-495 ; 501-520 ; 524-536 ; 544-557 ; 561-570 ; 570-594 ; 634-641 ; 650-661 ; 662-671 ; 674-720 ; 728-734 ; 737-750 ; 752-783 ; 791-797 ; 800-809 ; 809-833 ; 840-845 ; 863-878 ; 884-889 ; 891-913 ; 915-935 ; 935-944 ; 948-960 ; 960-964 ; 965-969 ; 973-982 ; 986-1022 ; 1065-1081 ; 1087-1102 ; 1109-1135 ; 1135-1147 ; 1166-1192 ; 1192-1205 ; 1235-1246 ; 1246-1250 ; 1252-1256 ; 1257-1261 ; 1263-1267", "doc_id": "medmentions_28088318", "dataset": "medmentions"}

The results of the present study provide insight into the key interactions and underlying inhibitory mechanism of a small molecule against \u03b22m aggregation that will help in the design and development of more potent, novel inhibitors of \u03b22m aggregation.", "target": "<TAG> 17-26 ; 60-64 ; 69-96 ; 111-114 ; 122-143 ; 164-176 ; 192-196 ; 197-212 ; 228-249 ; 252-256 ; 275-278 ; 279-282 ; 294-320 ; 327-345 ; 348-352 ; 359-367 ; 370-382 ; 382-395 ; 436-452 ; 455-459 ; 550-561 ; 561-571 ; 599-603 ; 603-615 ; 682-693 ; 696-700", "doc_id": "medmentions_28455257", "dataset": "medmentions"}

Here we show that if the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is increased by visual stimulation or using chemogenetics, their axons regenerate. We also show that if enhancement of neural activity is combined with elevation of the cell-growth -promoting pathway involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RGC axons regenerate long distances and re-innervate the brain. Analysis of genetically labeled RGCs revealed that this regrowth can be target specific: RGC axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided targets incorrect for their function. Moreover, these regenerated connections were successful in partially rescuing a subset of visual behaviors. Our findings indicate that combining neural activity with activation of mTOR can serve as powerful tool for enhancing axon regeneration, and they highlight the remarkable capacity of CNS neurons to re-establish accurate circuit connections in adulthood.", "target": "<TAG> 6-15 ; 39-46 ; 48-57 ; 57-70 ; 79-87 ; 87-93 ; 93-99 ; 106-116 ; 116-120 ; 120-125 ; 128-139 ; 145-152 ; 178-187 ; 190-196 ; 196-219 ; 221-225 ; 229-239 ; 242-261 ; 291-297 ; 297-308 ; 330-342 ; 345-352 ; 352-361 ; 378-388 ; 395-407 ; 418-426 ; 436-466 ; 468-472 ; 474-478 ; 478-484 ; 484-495 ; 514-527 ; 531-537 ; 538-547 ; 550-570 ; 570-575 ; 594-603 ; 610-617 ; 617-626 ; 627-631 ; 631-637 ; 669-676 ; 676-684 ; 696-704 ; 704-714 ; 724-733 ; 750-762 ; 762-774 ; 824-841 ; 846-855 ; 879-886 ; 886-895 ; 900-911 ; 914-919 ; 950-960 ; 960-978 ; 1002-1022 ; 1025-1029 ; 1029-1037 ; 1062-1070 ; 1070-1082 ; 1085-1095", "doc_id": "medmentions_27399843", "dataset": "medmentions"}

This study proposes international definitions for neonatal infections. The neonatal infections GAIA working group performed a literature review using Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane collaboration and collected definitions in use in neonatal and public health networks.

Despite its importance in determining outcomes, extravasation from circulation remains a \"black box.\" The objective of this study is to develop predictive tools for optimization of drug delivery systems. By comparing pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin in tumor -free and tumor bearing mice we quantitatively assess the rate constants for distribution, elimination, and tumor accumulation.

This protocol describes conditional reprogramming (CR), which involves coculture of irradiated mouse fibroblast feeder cells with normal and tumor human epithelial cells in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632).

The method requires a pathologist to differentiate healthy tissue from tumor tissue, and basic tissue culture skills. The protocol can be used with cells derived from both fresh and cryopreserved tissue samples.

Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating \" normally \" (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies. Thus, the evolutionary approach suggests that psychiatry should sometimes think differently about distress and impairment.

The Snf5 subunit is shown by crosslinking-mass spectrometry (CX-MS) and subunit deletion analysis to interact with the ATPase domain of Snf2 and to form a submodule consisting of Snf5, Swp82, and Taf14. Snf5 promotes binding of the Snf2 ATPase domain to nucleosomal DNA and enhances the catalytic and nucleosome remodeling activities of SWI/SNF. Snf5 is also required for SWI/SNF recruitment by acidic transcription factors. RNA-seq analysis suggests that both the recruitment and remodeling functions of Snf5 are required in vivo for SWI/SNF regulation of gene expression.

Many risk factors are inter-related and study designs often do not enable differentiation between cause and consequence of infection. Despite differences in study design and location, some risk factors are consistently identified, e.g. herd size, bTB history, presence of infected wildlife, whereas the evidence for others is less consistent and coherent, e.g. nutrition, local cattle movements.

This was a qualitative study based on individual telephone interviews, analysed by means of qualitative content analysis and inspired by interpretive description. 17 participants were recruited from two different-sized Danish hospitals and identified by applying a purposeful sample strategy. The main theme expressed the women's overall experience with the rebozo: \"Joined movements in a harmless effort towards a natural birth \". The women experienced that the technique created bodily sensations, which reduced their pain, and furthermore they expressed that it interrelated the labour process and produced mutual involvement and psychological support from the midwife and the women's partner. The rebozo technique was in most situations carried out because the midwife suspected a foetus malposition. The experiences of the rebozo technique were overall positive and both of a physical and psychological nature. The results indicate that health professionals should view rebozo as an easy accessible clinical tool with high user acceptance and possible positive psychological and clinical implications.

Seventeen healthy participants sat with their feet on sliding panels that were moved externally over the same or different amplitudes. The participants were asked to generate simultaneous knee flexion-extension movements, or to let their feet be dragged, resulting in reference foot displacements of 150 mm and experimental foot displacements of 150, 120, or 90 mm.

Definitive CHIKV diagnosis is crucial, especially in distinguishing the disease from dengue virus, which co-circulates in endemic areas and shares the same mosquito vectors. Laboratory diagnosis is mainly based on serological or molecular approaches. The E2 glycoprotein is a good candidate for serological diagnosis since it is the immunodominant antigen during the course of infection, and reacts with seropositive CHIKV sera.

Data from a community sample of adults with serious mental illness (N = 268) were collected through structured interviews. Regression -based analyses were used to examine the main effects of internalized stigma on recovery orientation and the moderating effect of cognitive insight.

Cognitive insight moderated the effect of self-application of stigmatizing beliefs on recovery orientation.

It generally occurs in children, and is not known to be associated with systemic disease. The authors report histopathological and clinical findings in 14 cases of subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid, including 3 older patients with unique microscopic features. Clinical records and pathological materials were critically reviewed in each case, including von kossa, CD3, CD20, and CD68 stains. The 14 cases presented clinically as nodular eyelid lesions. All were treated with surgical excision. The authors found 2 distinct histopathological patterns which correlated with the patients ' age.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of crown fracture in the primary dentition over a 1-year follow-up period, identify risk factors, and test the hypothesis that children with previous crown fracture are more prone to experience further cases of crown fracture independently of other risk factors. This study was developed in two phases: cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study. The cross-sectional study was carried out 261 preschool children. The prospective longitudinal study was carried out 194 children allocated to two groups: exposed group (children with prior exposure to crown fracture) and non - exposed group (children without prior exposure). On both occasions, children were examined for the diagnosis of crown fracture and evaluation of lip coverage and overjet. The parents were interviewed with regard to the socioeconomic indicators.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome - targeting cancer drugs The proteasome holoenzyme is the major non-lysosomal protease; its proteolytic activity is essential for cellular homeostasis. Thus, it is an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics. While the structural basis of core particle (CP) inhibitors is largely understood, their structural impact on the proteasome holoenzyme remains entirely elusive. Here, we determined the structure of the 26S proteasome with and without the inhibitor Oprozomib. Drug binding modifies the energy landscape of conformational motion in the proteasome regulatory particle (RP). Structurally, the energy barrier created by Oprozomib triggers a long-range allosteric regulation, resulting in the stabilization of a non-productive state. Thereby, the chemical drug-binding signal is converted, propagated and amplified into structural changes over a distance of more than 150 \u00c5 from the proteolytic site to the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10. The direct visualization of changes in conformational dynamics upon drug binding allows new ways to screen and develop future allosteric proteasome inhibitors.", "target": "<TAG> 10-32 ; 39-60 ; 64-78 ; 80-90 ; 90-103 ; 107-118 ; 118-129 ; 142-165 ; 170-191 ; 194-204 ; 208-229 ; 245-256 ; 256-263 ; 271-283 ; 286-304 ; 326-332 ; 335-365 ; 405-412 ; 419-430 ; 430-441 ; 509-523 ; 544-554 ; 554-564 ; 565-578 ; 578-587 ; 598-608 ; 611-633 ; 640-651 ; 651-671 ; 673-675 ; 695-710 ; 721-731 ; 731-740 ; 742-753 ; 753-775 ; 793-807 ; 847-869 ; 869-876 ; 879-889 ; 890-901 ; 905-915 ; 920-931 ; 931-939 ; 946-955 ; 983-1000 ; 1007-1026 ; 1026-1032 ; 1037-1058 ; 1061-1069 ; 1072-1096 ; 1101-1114 ; 1133-1140 ; 1159-1170 ; 1170-1192", "doc_id": "medmentions_28541292", "dataset": "medmentions"}
{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Family Environment and Childhood Obesity: A New Framework with Structural Equation Modeling The main purpose of the current article is to introduce a framework of the complexity of childhood obesity based on the family environment. A conceptual model that quantifies the relationships and interactions among parental socioeconomic status, family food security level, child's food intake and certain aspects of parental feeding behaviour is presented using the structural equation modeling (SEM) concept. Structural models are analysed in terms of the direct and indirect connections among latent and measurement variables that lead to the child weight indicator. To illustrate the accuracy, fit, reliability and validity of the introduced framework, real data collected from 630 families from Urumqi (Xinjiang, China) were considered. The framework includes two categories of data comprising the normal body mass index (BMI) range and obesity data. The comparison analysis between two models provides some evidence that in obesity modeling, obesity data must be extracted from the dataset and analysis must be done separately from the normal BMI range.

We report two studies that investigate how ingroup favoritism evolves over time in social interaction. The levels of ingroup favoritism were affected by categorization and inequality, and the level of ingroup favoritism changed over time, increasing or decreasing depending on the nature of the initial intergroup structure.

A variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are associated with these infections but Escherichia coli contributes up to 80% of cases. Multiple bacterial species including E. coli can grow in human urine as a means to maintain colonization during infections.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> How Can We Estimate Sepsis Incidence and Mortality? Sepsis is one of the oldest and complex syndromes in medicine that has been in debate for over two millennia. Valid and comparable data on the population burden of sepsis constitute an essential resource for guiding health policy and resource allocation. Despite current epidemiological data suggesting that the global burden of sepsis is huge, the knowledge of its incidence, prevalence, mortality, and case-fatality rates is subject to several flaws. The objective of this narrative review is to assess how sepsis incidence and mortality can be estimated, providing examples on how it has been done so far in medical literature and discussing its possible biases. Results of recent studies suggest that sepsis incidence rates are increasing consistently during the last decades. Although estimates might be biased, this probably reflects a real increase in incidence over time. Nevertheless, case fatality rates have decreased, which is a probable reflex of advances in critical care provision to this very sick population at high risk of death. This conclusion can only be drawn with a reasonable degree of certainty for high-income countries. Conversely, adequately designed studies from middle - and low-income countries are urgently needed.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the serratus anterior could be subdivided into different structural parts on the basis of its segmental architectural parameters. Eight formalin - embalmed serratus anterior muscles were dissected and the attachments of each fascicle documented.

The resemblance indicated that 1 kg lower birthweight is associated with similar metabolic aberrations as caused by 0.92 units higher BMI in adulthood. Lower birthweight adjusted for gestational age is associated with adverse biomarker aberrations across multiple metabolic pathways. Coherent metabolic signatures between lower birthweight and higher adult adiposity suggest that shared molecular pathways may potentially underpin the metabolic deviations. However, the magnitudes of metabolic associations with birthweight are modest in comparison to the effects of adiposity, implying that birthweight is only a weak indicator of the metabolic risk profile in adulthood.", "target": "<TAG> 20-30 ; 30-48 ; 48-60 ; 97-115 ; 115-121 ; 121-137 ; 139-142 ; 144-162 ; 175-191 ; 205-221 ; 221-237 ; 237-248 ; 259-271 ; 271-282 ; 283-295 ; 296-308 ; 312-320 ; 323-336 ; 340-364 ; 383-392 ; 430-438 ; 453-458 ; 461-481 ; 490-501 ; 506-511 ; 527-537 ; 537-548 ; 548-564 ; 564-582 ; 596-616 ; 619-626 ; 626-632 ; 632-636 ; 650-659 ; 683-703 ; 740-758 ; 761-777 ; 785-795 ; 810-820 ; 831-838 ; 838-842 ; 842-855 ; 856-874 ; 887-903 ; 906-922 ; 930-940 ; 968-987 ; 988-997 ; 997-1018 ; 1026-1044 ; 1048-1055 ; 1055-1061 ; 1061-1071 ; 1091-1110 ; 1139-1149 ; 1149-1160 ; 1174-1185 ; 1188-1198 ; 1198-1216 ; 1216-1228 ; 1260-1271 ; 1271-1281 ; 1296-1308 ; 1318-1323 ; 1323-1333 ; 1340-1363 ; 1363-1376", "doc_id": "medmentions_27892411", "dataset": "medmentions"}

Whilst community nurses have a key role to play in the delivery of palliative care, specific interventions for dignity are lacking. A mixed methods study using online survey and focus group interviews and thematic analysis to examine data. Twenty four community nurses implemented the dignity care intervention for people with advanced and life-limiting conditions were recruited from four pilot sites across Ireland. Four focus group interviews and on line survey were conducted between March-June 2015. The community nurses found the dignity care intervention useful. It helped the nurses to provide holistic end-of-life care and assisted in the overall assessment of palliative care patients, identifying areas that might not otherwise have been noted.

Moreover, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease. This study aimed to explore the health behaviors of patients diagnosed with NPC and the possible causes of patient delay in NPC diagnosis. A qualitative research method was used to gain better insight into patient behaviors. Twelve patients were interviewed using semi-structured interview guidelines. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed according to a standard content analysis framework. Most patients had limited knowledge regarding NPC and its causes. Fifty percent of the patients had a delay of six months from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis. The main reason for this delay was the lack of awareness among the patients, which was influenced by their environment, economic status, family, culture, and religion. The perceived barriers to seeking medical help included direct non- medical costs not covered by health insurance, complex and time-consuming insurance and referral systems, and negative experiences in the past.

Post - fertilization demethylation of paternal and maternal genomes is considered to occur by an active and passive mechanism respectively, in most mammals but sheep; in this species no loss of methylation was observed in either pronucleus. Post - fertilization reprogramming relies on methylating and demethylating enzymes and co-factors that are stored during oocyte growth, concurrently with the re-methylation of the oocyte itself.

The main contributing factor was identified in 69/79 (87%) cases. Most identified AEs, 55/69 (80%), were due to patient - specific factors such as comorbidities. Patient -to- provider and provider -to- provider communication accounted for 16/69 (23%) of events and was the second most common cause. Other causes included protocol non-adherence and technology / equipment issues. After each detailed review, the multidisciplinary panel recommended system changes that addressed the primary cause.

The C9orf72 protein, predicted to be a DENN-family protein, is reduced in ALS and FTD, but its functions remain poorly understood. Using a 3110043O21Rik / C9orf72 knockout mouse model, as well as cellular analysis, we have found that loss of C9orf72 causes alterations in the signaling states of central autophagy regulators. In particular, C9orf72 depletion leads to reduced activity of MTOR, a negative regulator of macroautophagy / autophagy, and concomitantly increased TFEB levels and nuclear translocation. Consistent with these alterations, cells exhibit enlarged lysosomal compartments and enhanced autophagic flux. Loss of the C9orf72 interaction partner SMCR8 results in similar phenotypes.

Our understanding of the role of the dorsal pathway, in particular, has greatly evolved within the framework of the two-pathway hypothesis since its original conception. Here, we present a comparative review of the primate dorsal pathway in humans and monkeys based on electrophysiological, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and neuroanatomical studies.

We also review the relative anatomical location of functionally - and topographically-defined regions of the posterior parietal cortex.

However, few studies have compared the biological characteristics of H9N2 viruses isolated from healthy chickens in Shanghai. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three H9N2 viruses - CK/SH/Y1/07, CK/SH/Y1/02, and CK/SH/23/13 - isolated from healthy chickens in Shanghai between 2002 and 2013, were selected and their biological characteristics were determined. RESULTS All 3 H9N2 viruses showed a preference for both the avian - and human-like receptors, and they replicated well in MDCK and A549 cells.

Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were added to increase the flexibility of the polymer and the conductivity of the electrode. An ECG electrode patch was fabricated by integrating the electrodes with an adhesive polydimethylsiloxane (aPDMS) layer.

A wireless ECG measurement system was developed and adapted to the polymer electrodes. The polymer electrodes combined with the measurement system were successfully applied in wireless, long-term recording of ECG signals. An eleven- day continuous test showed that the ECG signal did not degrade over time.

The authors expect that further CAR engineering will enable us to target more antigens involved in hematological and solid malignancies with minimal side effects to serve unmet clinical needs.", "target": "<TAG> 12-16 ; 29-39 ; 39-50 ; 59-70 ; 74-90 ; 90-95 ; 116-137 ; 140-145 ; 179-186 ; 190-199 ; 220-232 ; 235-245 ; 245-257 ; 257-261 ; 266-277 ; 277-281 ; 296-304 ; 325-329 ; 331-341 ; 341-347 ; 352-362 ; 362-371 ; 372-384 ; 388-396 ; 396-405 ; 405-413 ; 416-427 ; 427-434 ; 434-443 ; 453-463 ; 467-477 ; 491-505 ; 505-509 ; 509-526 ; 531-539 ; 539-555 ; 555-564 ; 576-582 ; 600-609 ; 609-615 ; 624-634 ; 634-639 ; 644-652 ; 672-676 ; 676-688 ; 706-713 ; 718-727 ; 727-736 ; 739-753 ; 757-776 ; 781-789 ; 789-802 ; 811-832", "doc_id": "medmentions_27618260", "dataset": "medmentions"}
{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Stochastic Subcellular Organization of Dense-Core Vesicles Revealed by Point Pattern Analysis Dense-core vesicles (DCVs) are regulated secretory organelles found in many types of neurons. In neurons of the hippocampus, their cargo includes proteins that mediate several pivotal processes, including differentiation and synaptic plasticity. Motivated by interest in DCV distribution and its impact on cargo action, we have used fluorescence microscopy and statistical analysis to develop a quantitative model of the subcellular organization of DCVs in hippocampal neurons that are spontaneously active (their most prevalent state). We also have tested the functionally motivated hypothesis that these organelles are synaptically enriched. Variance-to-mean ratio, frequency distribution, and Moran's autocorrelation analyses reveal that DCV distribution along shafts, and within synapses, follows Poisson statistics, establishing that stochastically dictated organization sustains cargo function. Occupancy in boutons exceeds that at nearby extrasynaptic axonal sites by approximately threefold, revealing significant local presynaptic enrichment.

For instance it inhibits photosynthesis through stomatal limitation, causes excessive accumulation of sodium and chloride in chloroplasts, and disturbs chloroplast potassium homeostasis. Most research on salt stress has focused primarily on cytosolic ion homeostasis with few studies of how salt stress affects chloroplast ion homeostasis. This review asks the question whether membrane-transport processes and ionic relations are differentially regulated between glycophyte and halophyte chloroplasts and whether this contributes to the superior salt tolerance of halophytes. The available literature indicates that halophytes can overcome stomatal limitation by switching to CO2 concentrating mechanisms and increasing the number of chloroplasts per cell under saline conditions. Furthermore, salt entry into the chloroplast stroma may be critical for grana formation and photosystem II activity in halophytes but not in glycophytes.

We sought to dissect the effect on antigenicity of each step of processing by using frozen sections as proxies of the whole tissue. An equivalent extent of antigen masking occurs across variable fixation times at room temperature. Most antigens benefit from longer fixation times (>24 hr) for optimal detection after antigen retrieval (AR; for example, Ki-67, bcl-2, ER). The transfer to a graded alcohol series results in an enhanced staining effect, reproduced by treating the sections with detergents, possibly because of a better access of the polymeric immunohistochemical detection system to tissue structures. A second round of masking occurs upon entering the clearing agent, mostly at the paraffin embedding step. This may depend on the non-freezable water removal.

In a mouse xenograft model, TFAP2C promoted lung tumorigenesis and disease aggressiveness via the miR-183 and miR-33a pathways. The study provides a mechanism of mitogenic and oncogenic signaling via two functionally opposed miRNAs and suggests that TFAP2C -induced cell cycle hyperactivation contributes to lung tumorigenesis.", "target": "<TAG> 10-20 ; 37-53 ; 99-112 ; 115-127 ; 143-149 ; 164-171 ; 171-186 ; 190-206 ; 206-228 ; 232-238 ; 238-243 ; 243-257 ; 273-280 ; 280-288 ; 288-295 ; 305-315 ; 315-326 ; 342-357 ; 360-379 ; 379-391 ; 420-446 ; 456-479 ; 482-497 ; 515-525 ; 531-553 ; 554-561 ; 570-575 ; 575-589 ; 593-616 ; 624-632 ; 636-644 ; 644-653 ; 658-664 ; 675-685 ; 688-698 ; 702-722 ; 776-783 ; 792-819 ; 834-839 ; 839-853", "doc_id": "medmentions_27593936", "dataset": "medmentions"}

In the present study, MicroRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) was performed in mouse Th0 and Th17 cells to determine the critical miRNAs that are related to Th17 differentiation. We found that miR-30a was significantly downregulated during mouse Th17 differentiation. In addition, the level of miR-30a in CD4(+) T cells from peripheral blood of MS patients and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models was also decreased and inversely correlated with the expression of interleukin 17a, the canonical cytokine of Th17 cells.

Previously we showed that support resources can facilitate resilience in carers, but the relationship is complex and varies by relationship type. The current paper aims to explore social support as a key component of resilience to identify the availability, function and perceived functional aspects of support provided to older spousal dementia carers. We conducted 23 in-depth qualitative interviews with spousal carers from two carer support groups and a care home in North West England. Family and friends served a wide range of functions but were equally available to resilient and non-resilient participants. Family support was perceived as unhelpful if it created feelings of over-dependence. Participants were less likely to resist involvement of grandchildren due to their relatively narrow and low-level support functions. Friend support was perceived as most helpful when it derived from those in similar circumstances. Neighbours played a functionally unique role of crisis management.

Despite being an effective analgesic for children with fractures, some clinicians may avoid prescribing ibuprofen due to its potentially harmful effect on bone healing. To determine if exposure to ibuprofen is associated with an increased risk of bone healing complications in children with fractures. We performed a retrospective study of children aged 6 months to 17 years who presented to the pediatric emergency department (PED) with a fracture of the tibia, femur, humerus, scaphoid, or fifth metatarsus and who followed up with the orthopedic service. We chose these fractures due to their higher risk for complications. We classified patients as exposed if they received ibuprofen in the PED or during hospitalization or were prescribed ibuprofen at discharge.

Preliminary staining is suggestive of a carcinoma given findings of organizing tubular structures seen on microscopy. The type of carcinoma is still under review but some stains are suggestive of renal cell carcinoma. CT suggests there is a renal nodule that is less likely to be renal cell.

Positive URI symptoms likely triggered flare. Of note, pt was supposed to follow up with pulmonology for PFTs but had to reschedule. She was started on a prednisone taper and a 3 day course of levaquin. Her symptoms improved dramatically. She was discharged on flovent instead of budesonide.
