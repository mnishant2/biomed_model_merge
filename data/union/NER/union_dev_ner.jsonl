BACKGROUND  Recently, mutations in the retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene which codes for peripherin-rds have been implicated as a cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Because this gene is expressed in both rods and cones, mutations in the rds gene might be expected to cause degeneration affecting either the scotopic or photopic systems.

The rare diseases ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), caused by mutations in the ATM gene, and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), with mutations in the p95/nbs1 gene, share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities such as chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity and defects in cell-cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation. The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs, whereas p95/nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double-strand breaks. Here, because of the similarities between AT and NBS, we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95/nbs1.

To clarify whether colchicine is excreted in breast milk, and to compare its concentrations in the serum and breast milk of lactating women who have familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). METHODS. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, we determined colchicine concentrations in the serum and breast milk of 4 patients at various time points, following oral administration of the drug. The study evaluated 4 patients with FMF who had been taking colchicine on a long-term basis. RESULTS. Colchicine was found to be excreted in breast milk.

Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis. In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate. Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced narcosis.

CASE: A 49-year-old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing. On electrocardiogram, episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour Holter monitoring recorded several events. The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol, but recurred a year later. The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol. After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol, the arrhythmia disappeared. DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia (SIAT) is a rare phenomenon. Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature. This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT.

BACKGROUND: Current animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically involve acute, drug-induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety.

METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. RESULTS: Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding, and corticostriatal dysfunction.

These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug-induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents. Apomorphine, a nonselective dopamine agonist, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia, and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain. From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed.

BACKGROUND: There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse.

Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy.

BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day.

The mechanism of isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage is unknown, but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs. demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed. Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol. Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins. We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration.

Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive.

Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study.

Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent.

Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system (central sensitization) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury (secondary hyperalgesia). Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain. Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization.

Semen was collected twice a week for 3 months during Se supplementation. Semen properties were evaluated from fresh ejaculate. Moreover, fructose concentration, aspartate and alanine transaminase (AST and ALT) activities, total protein and total cholesterol were assayed in seminal plasma. Additionally AST, ALT, testosterone and Se levels were determined in the blood serum. Results showed that Se supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) influences the semen parameters during 3 months of treatment. Organic Se significantly (P < 0.05) increased the percentage of viable sperms compared to inorganic Se and the control group.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection without individual genotypes: The local score approach Detecting genomic footprints of selection is an important step in the understanding of evolution. Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans increases detection power, but haplotype -based methods require individual genotypes and are not applicable on pool-sequenced samples. We propose to take advantage of the local score approach to account for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection, cumulating (possibly small) signals from single markers over a genomic segment, to clearly pinpoint a selection signal. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this approach detects selection with higher power than several state-of-the-art single-marker, windowing or haplotype -based approaches.

In this study, lipid - polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), which contain both pemetrexed and miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-21), have been developed for treatment of glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumor. Prepared LPNs have been well characterized by particle size distribution and zeta potential measurements, determination of encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release experiments. Morphology of LPNs was determined by transmission electron microscopy. LPNs had a hydrodynamic size below 100 nm and exhibited sustained release of pemetrexed up to 10 h.

Numerous studies have been carried out in order to investigate the mechanisms of toxicity of these substances, with particular regard to the possible toxic effects on the immune system. However, little is known about the influence of heavy metals, such as lead, on the immune system in human populations. Lead is a heavy metal still used in many industrial activities. Human exposure to lead can induce various biological effects depending upon the level and duration of exposure, such as toxic effects on haematological, cardiovascular, nervous and reproductive systems. Several studies demonstrated that exposure to lead is associated to toxic effects also on the immune system, thus increasing the incidence of allergy, infectious disease, autoimmunity or cancer. However, the effects of lead exposure on the human immune system are not conclusive, mostly in occupationally exposed subjects; nevertheless some immunotoxic abnormalities induced by lead have been suggested.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Vestibular ablation and a semicircular canal prosthesis affect postural stability during head turns In our study, we examined postural stability during head turns for two rhesus monkeys: one animal study contrasted normal and mild bilateral vestibular ablation and a second animal study contrasted severe bilateral vestibular ablation with and without prosthetic stimulation. The monkeys freely stood, unrestrained on a balance platform and made voluntary head turns between visual targets. To quantify each animals ' posture, motions of the head and trunk, as well as torque about the body's center of mass, were measured. In the mildly ablated animal, we observed less foretrunk sway in comparison with the normal state. When the canal prosthesis provided electric stimulation to the severely ablated animal, it showed a decrease in trunk sway during head turns. Because the rhesus monkey with severe bilateral vestibular loss exhibited a decrease in trunk sway when receiving vestibular prosthetic stimulation, we propose that the prosthetic electrical stimulation partially restored head velocity information.

Low recovery of metal is typical for these complex deposits leading to significant losses to tailings. In addition, the minerals often contain impurities, some toxic, which are difficult and costly to control or manage during the processing of a concentrate or other mineral product.

However, current staging guidelines for superficially invasive cancers do not acknowledge the variability in type and extent of lamina propria invasion in papillary urothelial carcinomas (PUC), and historically proposed substaging systems showed either high inter-observer variation or limited value in predicting patient outcomes. Herein we reappraise pT1 PUC substaging, aiming to identify a novel scheme which is reproducible and prognostically meaningful. Stage pT1 PUC diagnosed during years 1999-2015 were retrospectively reviewed and characterized as focal invasion confined to papillary stalk, focal invasion of tumor base, or extensive invasion of tumor base.

We calculated cumulative incidence of recurrence, progression, and death by tumor subtype and evaluated differential risks using log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by type and extent of invasion. Among 62 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 22 of 29 patients with base extensive invasion progressed while 4 of 13 with base focal and 0 of 20 with stalk only invasion progressed. There was strong evidence that base extensive patients had higher risk of progression and death due to bladder cancer than base focal or stalk only counterparts (P<0.0001). However, tumor subtype was not significantly associated with risk of recurrence (P=0.21).

Here we show that if the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is increased by visual stimulation or using chemogenetics, their axons regenerate. We also show that if enhancement of neural activity is combined with elevation of the cell-growth -promoting pathway involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), RGC axons regenerate long distances and re-innervate the brain. Analysis of genetically labeled RGCs revealed that this regrowth can be target specific: RGC axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided targets incorrect for their function. Moreover, these regenerated connections were successful in partially rescuing a subset of visual behaviors.

Mean age of 774 patients was 78 ± 6 years. A decrease was observed in all OAB symptoms including a reduction of urinary urgency and micturition, each by 4 episodes per 24 h. No change in mean MMSE score s was apparent at week 12. Adverse events and treatment discontinuations were low at 5.8 and 0.5%, respectively. Solifenacin was well-tolerated while OAB symptoms declined at week 12.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> The Role of Simulation in Surgical Education The current healthcare environment demands optimization of patient outcomes in addition to maximal cost efficiency. Restrictions on resident work hours have placed limitations on the amount of time that trainee physicians can spend on patient care. For the surgery resident, the consequence is less time spent in the operating room under the supervision of a senior surgeon, the cornerstone of Halsted's approach to resident surgeon education. The use of simulation in graduate medical education has gained significant traction as a way to provide trainees with exposure to various techniques and procedures before use on the general patient population. This article describes simulation - based education with particular attention to surgical education.

One possibility to overcome this problem might be found in the application of mucoadhesive dosage forms like gastrointestinal wafers.

One suggested solution might be the combination of gastrointestinal wafers and expanding systems. Such a combination requires thin and elastic wafers which are further characterized by an unidirectional drug release.

This protocol describes conditional reprogramming (CR), which involves coculture of irradiated mouse fibroblast feeder cells with normal and tumor human epithelial cells in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632). CR cells can be used for various applications, including regenerative medicine, drug sensitivity testing, gene expression profiling and xenograft studies. The method requires a pathologist to differentiate healthy tissue from tumor tissue, and basic tissue culture skills. The protocol can be used with cells derived from both fresh and cryopreserved tissue samples.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Using Evolutionary Theory to Guide Mental Health Research Evolutionary approaches to medicine can shed light on the origins and etiology of disease. Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating \" normally \" (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies.

Many risk factors are inter-related and study designs often do not enable differentiation between cause and consequence of infection. Despite differences in study design and location, some risk factors are consistently identified, e.g. herd size, bTB history, presence of infected wildlife, whereas the evidence for others is less consistent and coherent, e.g. nutrition, local cattle movements.

We also searched for reports of patients diagnosed with r(20) syndrome in the literature, included those whose clinical information was sufficiently accurate, and compared their clinical features with the ones of our patients. Epilepsy exhibited an age dependent course.

The main theme expressed the women's overall experience with the rebozo: \"Joined movements in a harmless effort towards a natural birth \". The women experienced that the technique created bodily sensations, which reduced their pain, and furthermore they expressed that it interrelated the labour process and produced mutual involvement and psychological support from the midwife and the women's partner. The rebozo technique was in most situations carried out because the midwife suspected a foetus malposition. The experiences of the rebozo technique were overall positive and both of a physical and psychological nature.

In total, 732 symptomatic patients with PAD admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery for conventional angiography at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, between January 2009 and August 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic factors, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and above foot level amputations were obtained and assessed in relation to AP, ABI, TP, and TBI by means of Kaplan-Meier life tables and a multivariate Cox regression model.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of crown fracture in the primary dentition over a 1-year follow-up period, identify risk factors, and test the hypothesis that children with previous crown fracture are more prone to experience further cases of crown fracture independently of other risk factors. This study was developed in two phases: cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal study. The cross-sectional study was carried out 261 preschool children. The prospective longitudinal study was carried out 194 children allocated to two groups: exposed group (children with prior exposure to crown fracture) and non - exposed group (children without prior exposure). On both occasions, children were examined for the diagnosis of crown fracture and evaluation of lip coverage and overjet. The parents were interviewed with regard to the socioeconomic indicators.

Thus, it is an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics. While the structural basis of core particle (CP) inhibitors is largely understood, their structural impact on the proteasome holoenzyme remains entirely elusive. Here, we determined the structure of the 26S proteasome with and without the inhibitor Oprozomib. Drug binding modifies the energy landscape of conformational motion in the proteasome regulatory particle (RP). Structurally, the energy barrier created by Oprozomib triggers a long-range allosteric regulation, resulting in the stabilization of a non-productive state. Thereby, the chemical drug-binding signal is converted, propagated and amplified into structural changes over a distance of more than 150 Å from the proteolytic site to the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10.

Structural models are analysed in terms of the direct and indirect connections among latent and measurement variables that lead to the child weight indicator. To illustrate the accuracy, fit, reliability and validity of the introduced framework, real data collected from 630 families from Urumqi (Xinjiang, China) were considered. The framework includes two categories of data comprising the normal body mass index (BMI) range and obesity data.

Biostimulation with root exudates, low molecular weight organic acids, of J. acutus did not improve BPA - degradation rates.

The objective of this narrative review is to assess how sepsis incidence and mortality can be estimated, providing examples on how it has been done so far in medical literature and discussing its possible biases. Results of recent studies suggest that sepsis incidence rates are increasing consistently during the last decades. Although estimates might be biased, this probably reflects a real increase in incidence over time. Nevertheless, case fatality rates have decreased, which is a probable reflex of advances in critical care provision to this very sick population at high risk of death. This conclusion can only be drawn with a reasonable degree of certainty for high-income countries. Conversely, adequately designed studies from middle - and low-income countries are urgently needed. In these countries, sepsis incidence and case-fatality rates could be disproportionally", "target": "O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O", "doc_id": "medmentions_27454379", "dataset": "medmentions"}

The serratus anterior is portrayed as a homogeneous muscle in textbooks and during functional activities and rehabilitation exercises. It is unclear whether the serratus anterior is composed of subdivisions with distinctive morphology and functions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the serratus anterior could be subdivided into different structural parts on the basis of its segmental architectural parameters. Eight formalin - embalmed serratus anterior muscles were dissected and the attachments of each fascicle documented. Orientation and size of each fascicle were measured and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) calculated. Three subdivisions of the serratus anterior were identified. A new finding was the discovery of two distinctive fascicles attached to the superior and inferior aspects of rib 2. The rib 2 inferior fascicle had the largest PCSA (mean 1.6 cm(2)) and attached, with the rib 3 fascicle, along the medial border of the scapula to form the middle division.

Lower birthweight adjusted for gestational age is associated with adverse biomarker aberrations across multiple metabolic pathways. Coherent metabolic signatures between lower birthweight and higher adult adiposity suggest that shared molecular pathways may potentially underpin the metabolic deviations.

The recovery of Ca(2+) -dependent signal transduction on motor end plates (MEPs) and innervated muscle may directly reflect nerve regeneration following peripheral nerve injury.

However, the low quality of such images makes it difficult to analyze them and diagnose diseases. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to improve the contrast and quality of liver ultrasound images. In this study, a number of image contrast enhancement algorithms which are based on fuzzy logic were applied to liver ultrasound images - in which the view of kidney is observable - using Matlab2013b to improve the image contrast and quality which has a fuzzy definition; just like image contrast improvement algorithms using a fuzzy intensification operator, contrast improvement algorithms applying fuzzy image histogram hyperbolization, and contrast improvement algorithms by fuzzy IF-THEN rules. With the measurement of Mean Squared Error and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio obtained from different images, fuzzy methods provided better results, and their implementation - compared with histogram equalization method - led both to the improvement of contrast and visual quality of images and to the improvement of liver segmentation algorithms results in images.

Engagement with the website (number of logins, time on site, modules viewed, action plans completed) was measured using tracking software. Other outcomes (website acceptability, physical activity behaviour) were assessed using online surveys. Physical activity outcomes were analysed using regression models for both study completers and when applying intention-to-treat (using multiple imputation). Completers allocated to the monthly module group rated the intervention higher (b = 2.2 95 % CI = 0.02-4.53) on acceptability and had higher levels of resistance-training (IRR = 1.88, 95 % CI = 1.16-3.04) than those in the single module group.

This study aimed to explore the health behaviors of patients diagnosed with NPC and the possible causes of patient delay in NPC diagnosis. A qualitative research method was used to gain better insight into patient behaviors. Twelve patients were interviewed using semi-structured interview guidelines. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed according to a standard content analysis framework. Most patients had limited knowledge regarding NPC and its causes.

Using a 3110043O21Rik / C9orf72 knockout mouse model, as well as cellular analysis, we have found that loss of C9orf72 causes alterations in the signaling states of central autophagy regulators. In particular, C9orf72 depletion leads to reduced activity of MTOR, a negative regulator of macroautophagy / autophagy, and concomitantly increased TFEB levels and nuclear translocation. Consistent with these alterations, cells exhibit enlarged lysosomal compartments and enhanced autophagic flux. Loss of the C9orf72 interaction partner SMCR8 results in similar phenotypes.

Thus, PR inhibitors (PIs) are the most effective class of anti-HIV drugs. However, the main challenge to the successful use of PI drugs in patient treatment is the emergence of multidrug resistant PRs (mdrPRs). This study aimed to develop a fission yeast cell-based system for rapid testing of new PIs that combat mdrPRs.

They were cloned and expressed in fission yeast under an inducible promoter to allow the measurement of PR -specific proteolysis and drug resistance. The results showed that all three mdrPRs maintained their abilities to proteolyze HIV viral substrates (MA ↓ CA and p6) and to confer drug resistance.

Our understanding of the role of the dorsal pathway, in particular, has greatly evolved within the framework of the two-pathway hypothesis since its original conception. Here, we present a comparative review of the primate dorsal pathway in humans and monkeys based on electrophysiological, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and neuroanatomical studies.

IGF2BP2 lists in the top rank up-regulated genes in GC, but its functional role is unclear. The expression of IGF2BP3 in GC cell lines and primary samples was examined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The biological role of IGF2BP3 was revealed by a series of functional in vitro studies. Its regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) was predicted by TargetScan and confirmed by luciferase assays and rescue experiments. IGF2BP3 ranked the No.1 of the up-regulated genes by expression microarray analysis in GC cell line s.

However, few studies have compared the biological characteristics of H9N2 viruses isolated from healthy chickens in Shanghai. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three H9N2 viruses - CK/SH/Y1/07, CK/SH/Y1/02, and CK/SH/23/13 - isolated from healthy chickens in Shanghai between 2002 and 2013, were selected and their biological characteristics were determined. RESULTS All 3 H9N2 viruses showed a preference for both the avian - and human-like receptors, and they replicated well in MDCK and A549 cells.

Startle modification (SRM) has been widely used to study stress disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder).

This review asks the question whether membrane-transport processes and ionic relations are differentially regulated between glycophyte and halophyte chloroplasts and whether this contributes to the superior salt tolerance of halophytes.

We sought to dissect the effect on antigenicity of each step of processing by using frozen sections as proxies of the whole tissue.

Most antigens benefit from longer fixation times (>24 hr) for optimal detection after antigen retrieval (AR; for example, Ki-67, bcl-2, ER). The transfer to a graded alcohol series results in an enhanced staining effect, reproduced by treating the sections with detergents, possibly because of a better access of the polymeric immunohistochemical detection system to tissue structures. A second round of masking occurs upon entering the clearing agent, mostly at the paraffin embedding step. This may depend on the non-freezable water removal.

This study aimed to determine the changing prescribing patterns associated with those reforms in township hospitals. Methods: A multi-stage stratified random cluster sampling method was adopted to identify 29 township hospitals from six counties in three provinces. A total of 2899 prescriptions were collected from the participating township hospitals using a systematic random sampling strategy. Seven prescribing indicators were calculated and compared between 2008 and 2013, assessing use of medicines (antibiotics and adrenal corticosteroids) and polypharmacy, administration route of medicines (injections), and affordability of medicines. Results: Significant changes in prescribing patterns were found. The average number of medicines and costs per- prescription dropped by about 50%. The percentage of prescriptions requiring antibiotics declined from 54% to 38%. The percentage of prescriptions requiring adrenal corticosteroid declined from 14% to 4%.

Angles of the shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle and tarsal joints were analyzed, including joint angle progression curves, minimum and maximum joint angles and range of motion (ROM). The old group showed a smaller maximum joint angle (p = 0.037) and ROM (p = 0.037) of the carpal joint and similar tendencies in the shoulder, elbow and carpal joint. The descriptive analysis of the progression curves revealed less flexion and extension of the joints of the forelimb. This indicates restricted joint mobility of the forelimb but primarily of the carpal joint. Findings in the joints of the hindlimb were not consistent; contrasting alterations may be due to a compensatory mechanism.", "target": "O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_28385001", "dataset": "medmentions"}

Community Engagement to Improve Health Outcomes from Artisanal Mining Mercury is an element that cannot be destroyed and is a global threat to human and environmental health. In Latin America and the Caribbean, artisanal and small-scale gold mining represents the main source of mercury emissions, releases, and consumption. However, another source of concern is the primary production of mercury. In the case of Mexico, in the past 2 years the informal production of mercury mining has increased 10-fold. Considering this scenario, an intervention program was initiated to reduce health risks in the mining communities.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Ecology and Feeding Habits Drive Infection of Water Bugs with Mycobacterium ulcerans Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, is present in a wide spectrum of environments, including terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in tropical regions. The most promising studies on the epidemiological risk of this disease suggest that some ecological settings may favor infection of animals with MU including human. A species ' needs and impacts on resources and the environment, i.e., its ecological niche, may influence its susceptibility to be infected by this microbial form. For example, some Naucoridae may dive in fresh waters to prey upon infected animals and thus may get infected with MU. However, these studies have rarely considered that inference on the ecological settings favoring infection and transmission may be confounded because host carrier sister species have similar ecological niches, and potentially the same host - microbe interactions. Hence, a relationship between the ecological niche of Naucoridae and its infection with MU may be due to a symbiotic relationship between the host and the pathogen, rather than its ecological niche.

The current paper aims to explore social support as a key component of resilience to identify the availability, function and perceived functional aspects of support provided to older spousal dementia carers. We conducted 23 in-depth qualitative interviews with spousal carers from two carer support groups and a care home in North West England. Family and friends served a wide range of functions but were equally available to resilient and non-resilient participants. Family support was perceived as unhelpful if it created feelings of over-dependence. Participants were less likely to resist involvement of grandchildren due to their relatively narrow and low-level support functions.

The NCDS was viewed as necessary and useful for national coordination, setting a common agenda and serving as an anchor to align jurisdictional priorities and action. However, without funding or other infrastructure commitments or implementation plans, any expectations as to what could be meaningfully achieved were limited.

Admit WBC was elevated 54.3, lactate 2.1 - but in the setting of GCSF. CT A/P showed evidence of mild enteroproctocolitis. Workup of her symptoms included the following: Flu: neg, Stool cdiff, salmonella/shigella/campylobacter were neg, CMV VL was undetectable. Of note, CXR was negative.

Positive URI symptoms likely triggered flare. Of note, pt was supposed to follow up with pulmonology for PFTs but had to reschedule. She was started on a prednisone taper and a 3 day course of levaquin. Her symptoms improved dramatically. She was discharged on flovent instead of budesonide.
