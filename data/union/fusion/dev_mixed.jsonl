This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections. The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low. However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients.

Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related cardiotoxicity.

We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies.

The retinoblastoma-predisposition gene, RB1, segregates as an autosomal dominant trait with high (90%) penetrance. Certain families, however, show an unusual low-penetrance phenotype with many individuals being unaffected, unilaterally affected, or with evidence of spontaneously regressed tumors. We have used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and PCR sequencing to study two such families. Mutations were found in exon 20 of RB1 in both cases. In one family a C----T transition in codon 661 converts an arginine (CGG) to a tryptophan (TGG) codon. In this family, incomplete penetrance and mild phenotypic expression were observed in virtually all patients, possibly indicating that single amino acid changes may modify protein structure/function such that tumorigenesis is not inevitable. In the second family the mutation in codon 675 is a G----T transversion that converts a glutamine (GAA) to a stop (TAA) codon.

Only a small subset of enriched genomic sites are located in intergenic regions at a relative short distance to a promoter, and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that only one additional operon is under activation of BarR, namely the glutamine synthase operon. The latter is also a target of other Lrp -like transcription factors. Detailed inspection of the BarR ChIP-seq profile at the \u03b2-alanine aminotransferase promoter region in combination with binding motif predictions indicate that the operator structure is more complicated than previously anticipated, consisting of multiple (major and auxiliary) operators.

Most patients (\u223c97%) have a severe FECH mutation (Mut) in trans to an intronic polymorphism (c.315-48C), which reduces ferrochelatase synthesis by stimulating the use of an aberrant 3' splice site 63 nt upstream of the normal site for exon 4. In contrast, with the predominant c.315-48T allele, the correct splice site is mostly used, and individuals with a T/Mut genotype do not develop EPP symptoms. Thus, the C allele is a potential target for therapeutic approaches that modify this splicing decision. To provide a model for pre-clinical studies of such approaches, we engineered a mouse containing a partly humanized Fech gene with the c.315-48C polymorphism. F1 hybrids obtained by crossing these mice with another inbred line carrying a severe Fech mutation (named m1Pas) show a very strong EPP phenotype that includes elevated PPIX in the blood, enlargement of liver and spleen, anemia, as well as strong pain reactions and skin lesions after a short period of light exposure.

Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated.

Results show a higher prevalence of the Active Solution strategy at home and in school contexts compared with the health area, where the Active Solution is the least prevalent strategy, and Concealing the Problem the most widely used, followed by Passivity. Other highly prevalent strategies in the school context include Search for Information, Emotion, and Social Support. In general, regardless of the context, Behavioural Avoidance and Passivity are the least prevalent strategies, whereas Active Solution is the most prevalent one, followed by Emotion.

By moving from methanol to water, the complexation changed from entropy driven to entropy opposed, leading to a drop of almost three orders in the magnitude of the Ka. However, this reduction in binding affinity is associated with a dramatic increase in selectivity, since in aqueous solutions only N-methylated amino acids are effectively recognized. The thermodynamic profile of the binding does not change in PBS solution. The pivotal role played by cation-\u03c0 interactions is demonstrated by the linear correlation found between the log Ka in methanol solution and the depth of (+)N-CH3 cavity inclusion in the molecular structures.

Its central part has sensory cells with rhabdomeres on 2, 3, or 4 sides, whereas those of the ventral retina have only two rhabdomeres on opposite sides. In addition, the rhabdomeres of the ventral retina are arranged in a specific way: Whereas in the most ventral part they form long tangential rows, those towards the center are detached and are arranged radially. All sensory cells are wrapped by unpigmented pigment cell processes. In agelenid spiders the axons of the sensory cells exit from the middle of the cell body; their fine structure and course through the eye cup is described in detail.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> The glycine transporter-1 inhibitor SSR103800 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic-like profile in normal and transgenic mice. Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission. However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor produce schizophrenic-like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor. As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor. Among them are glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as SSR103800, which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine (a co-agonist for the NMDA receptor) levels in the synapse.

The peptide was used instead of the sialyloligosaccharide receptor, which is the common receptor of influenza A and B viruses required during the early phase of infection, to capture IFV particles. The peptide, which was previously identified by phage-display technology, was immobilized by click chemistry on the BDD electrode, which has excellent electrochemical characteristics such as low background current and weak adsorption of biomolecules. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that H1N1 and H3N2 IFVs were detectable in the range of 20-500 pfu by using the peptide-terminated B", "target": "boron-doped diamond electrode|C0013812 ; sialic acid-mimic peptide|C0295247 ; progression of influenza|C0242656 ; underlying disease|C0012634 ; appropriate treatment|C3640049 ; prevent severe disease|C0679698 ; Anti-influenza therapy|C2076608 ; neuraminidase inhibitors|C3541969 ; effective|C1704419 ; diagnosis|C0011900 ; early phase of infection|C1254367 ; viral propagation|C0242656 ; plaque-forming units|C1882406 ; pfu|C1882406 ; influenza virus|C0029347 ; IFV|C0029347 ; boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode|C0013812 ; sialic acid-mimic peptide|C0295247 ; peptide|C0030956 ; sialyloligosaccharide receptor|C0074488 ; receptor|C0034848 ; influenza A|C0029347 ; B viruses|C0029348 ; early phase of infection|C1254367 ; IFV particles|C0042760 ; peptide|C0030956 ; phage-display technology|C3494191 ; immobilized|C2350558 ; click chemistry|C2936295 ; BDD electrode|C0013812 ; excellent electrochemical characteristics|C0205556 ; low background current|C0205556 ; adsorption of biomolecules|C0001674 ; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy|C2936361 ; H1N1|C1615607 ; H3N2 IFVs|C1615053 ; detectable|C3830527 ; pfu|C1882406", "doc_id": "medmentions_27457924", "dataset": "EL"}

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Function of terahertz spectra in monitoring the decomposing process of biological macromolecules and in investigating the causes of photoinhibition Chlorophyll a and \u03b2-carotene play an important role in harvesting light energy, which is used to drive photosynthesis in plants. In this study, terahertz (THz) and visible range spectra of chlorophyll a and \u03b2-carotene and their changes under light treatment were investigated. The results show that the all THz transmission and absorption spectra of chlorophyll a and \u03b2-carotene changed upon light treatment, with the maximum changes at 15 min of illumination indicating the greatest changes of the collective vibrational mode of chlorophyll a and \u03b2-carotene.

Accurate meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation - essential to prevent miscarriage or developmental defects - thus occur through atypical mechanisms that are not well characterized. Using quantitative in vitro and in vivo functional assays in the C. elegans oocyte, we provide novel evidence that the kinesin-13 KLP-7 promotes destabilization of the whole cellular microtubule network. By counteracting ectopic microtubule assembly and disorganization of the microtubule network, this function is strictly required for spindle organization, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in meiotic cells. Strikingly, when centrosome activity was experimentally reduced, the absence of KLP-7 or the mammalian kinesin-13 protein MCAK (KIF2C) also resulted in ectopic microtubule asters during mitosis in C. elegans zygotes or HeLa cells, respectively.

To carry out the ecohydrological modeling, the following information was used: bathymetry, physical and hydraulic features, and the Habitat Suitability Index for species of the Hypostomus auroguttatus. In the River2D, the Weighted Usable Areas were determined from the average long-term streamflows with percentage from 10% to 100%. Those streamflows were simulated for the later construction of optimization matrices that maximize the habitat area throughout the year. For H. auroguttatus Juvenile, higher values of Weighted Usable Area were associated with the percentage of 60% and 70% of the average long-term streamflows in October and September, respectively.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Dominant negative effect of the APC1309 mutation: a possible explanation for genotype-phenotype correlations in familial adenomatous polyposis. Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis. Patients with familial APC (FAP) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life. The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation (genotype-phenotype correlation). Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene, this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants. Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309. In contrast, mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis (codon 386 or 1465) interfered only weakly with wild-type", "target": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O", "doc_id": "ncbi_10213492", "dataset": "NER"}

BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, crocins, as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) in male rats was investigated.

In Alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated.

Mice were tested for spatial memory performance (radial arm water maze), sensorimotor coordination (computerized gait analysis, CatWalk), and cerebromicrovascular function (whisker - stimulation -induced increases in CBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry) at 3 to 6 months post - irradiation. We found that mice with WBI exhibited impaired cerebromicrovascular function at 3 months post - irradiation, which was associated with impaired performance in the radial arm water maze. At 6 months, post - irradiation progressive impairment in gait coordination (including changes in the regularity index and phase dispersion) was also evident. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for early and persisting neurovascular impairment after a clinically relevant protocol of fractionated WBI, which predict early manifestations of cognitive impairment.", "target": "B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_28299642", "dataset": "NER"}

For both of these abilities, recent studies have reported that the stored body representations involved are highly distorted, at least in the case of the hand, with the hand dorsum represented as wider and squatter than it actually is. Here, we investigated whether individual differences in the magnitude of these distortions are shared between tactile distance perception and position sense, as would be predicted by the hypothesis that a single distorted body model underlies both tasks. We used established tasks to measure distortions of the represented shape of the hand dorsum. Consistent with previous results, in both cases there were clear biases to overestimate distances oriented along the medio-lateral axis of the hand compared to the proximo-distal axis. Moreover, within each task there were clear split-half correlations, demonstrating that both tasks show consistent individual differences. Critically, however, there was no correlation between the magnitudes of distortion in the two tasks.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 15 supervisors from different veterinary subdisciplines, to elicit descriptions of excellent, weak and marginal students. Thematic analysis of transcriptions revealed 12 themes, of which engagement was frequently discussed and of stated importance, and trustworthiness was a differentiator of weak and marginal students from excellent students. Other themes were knowledge, application of knowledge, technical and animal handling skills, communication, social interaction, personal functioning, caring for animals, impact, prospects and the difficulty in judging competency. Patterns of association of themes were found, however themes were also used independently in unique combinations for most students described. The findings show the range of abilities, behaviours, attitudes and personal characteristics of students that are considered by supervisors and how these are weighted and balanced.

Relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes (IGFBP5, HSIX1, and Slug) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> The Role of SufS Is Restricted to Fe-S Cluster Biosynthesis in Escherichia coli In Escherichia coli, two different systems that are important for the coordinate formation of Fe-S clusters have been identified, namely, the ISC and SUF systems. The ISC system is the housekeeping Fe-S machinery, which provides Fe-S clusters for numerous cellular proteins. The IscS protein of this system was additionally revealed to be the primary sulfur donor for several sulfur-containing molecules with important biological functions, among which are the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) and thiolated nucleosides in tRNA. Here, we show that deletion of central components of the ISC system in addition to IscS leads to an overall decrease in Fe-S cluster enzyme and molybdoenzyme activity in addition to a decrease in the number of Fe-S - dependent thiomodifications of tRNA, based on the fact that some proteins involved in Moco biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation are Fe-S - dependent. Complementation of the ISC deficient strains with the suf operon restored the activity of Fe-S-containing proteins, including the MoaA protein, which is involved in the conversion of 5'GTP to cyclic pyranopterin", "target": "SufS|C3824407 ; Fe-S Cluster|C3824418 ; Biosynthesis|C0005572 ; Escherichia coli|C0014834 ; Escherichia coli|C0014834 ; Fe-S clusters|C3824418 ; ISC|C3824418 ; SUF systems|C3824407 ; ISC system|C3824418 ; housekeeping Fe-S machinery|C1334046 ; Fe-S clusters|C3824418 ; cellular proteins|C0033684 ; IscS protein|C0675681 ; primary sulfur donor|C1254355 ; sulfur-containing molecules|C0567416 ; biological functions|C3714634 ; molybdenum cofactor|C0066697 ; Moco|C0066697 ; thiolated nucleosides in tRNA|C2247814 ; deletion|C0162773 ; ISC system|C3824418 ; IscS|C0675681 ; Fe-S cluster|C3824418 ; enzyme|C0014442 ; molybdoenzyme activity|C0243102 ; Fe-S|C3824418 ; dependent|C3244310 ; thiomodifications of tRNA|C2247814 ; proteins|C0033684 ; Moco|C0066697 ; biosynthesis|C0005572 ; tRNA thiolation|C2247814 ; Fe-S|C3824418 ; dependent|C3244310 ; ISC|C3824417 ; deficient|C0011155 ; suf|C3824407 ; operon|C0029073 ; Fe-S-containing proteins|C0022095 ; MoaA protein|C4044190 ; 5'GTP|C0018353", "doc_id": "medmentions_28323419", "dataset": "EL"}

TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions. Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes. The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) and alpha-tocopherol acetate (alpha-TAc) (inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM-induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage.

Moreover, safety information on cosmetic materials has neither been collected in a database nor shared among researchers. Therefore, it is imperative to build and share a database of safety information on toxicological mechanisms and pathways collected through in vivo, in vitro, and in silico methods.

On the same website, our aim is to provide updates on current alternative research methods in Korea.

LIBRE is a multicentre (three university hospitals during this pilot phase), unblinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Women with a BRCA1 / 2 mutation of age 18 or over who provided written consent were eligible for the trial. As part of the assessment, all were given a full-length Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and MEDAS at baseline and after 3 months. Data derived from FFQ was compared to MEDAS in order to evaluate agreement or concordance between the two questionnaires.

Iliac crest is the common autograft donor site, but its use presents an increased risk for donor site pain, morbidity and infection. Degenerative bone samples harvested during facetectomy might provide an alternative viable source of osteoinductive autografts. In this study, we conducted an intra-individual comparison of the osteogenic potential of isolated low passage MSC from both sources. Iliac crest and degenerative facet joints were harvested from eight consecutive patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interspinal fusion due to lumbar spinal stenosis.

Processes associated with climatic changes, such as elevated temperatures, can strongly affect weed control efficiency. Responses of several grass weed populations to herbicides that inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) were examined under different temperature regimes. We characterized the mechanism of temperature -dependent sensitivity and the kinetics of pinoxaden detoxification. The products of pinoxaden detoxification were quantified. Decreased sensitivity to ACCase inhibitors was observed under elevated temperatures. Pre-treatment with the cytochrome-P450 inhibitor malathion supports a non-target site metabolism -based mechanism of herbicide resistance.

To clarify whether colchicine is excreted in breast milk, and to compare its concentrations in the serum and breast milk of lactating women who have familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). METHODS. Using a specific radioimmunoassay, we determined colchicine concentrations in the serum and breast milk of 4 patients at various time points, following oral administration of the drug. The study evaluated 4 patients with FMF who had been taking colchicine on a long-term basis. RESULTS. Colchicine was found to be excreted in breast milk. Its levels ranged between 1. 9 and 8. 6 ng/ml, which were similar to those found in the serum (parallel concentration time curves). However, there appeared to be a considerable variation in colchicine milk concentration among the different patients, which might be related to individual breast milk composition and, possibly, to other nutritional or metabolic factors. CONCLUSION. The extensive peripheral tissue binding and relatively low concentration of colchicine in breast milk suggests that the amount ingested by the infant is small.

We calculated cumulative incidence of recurrence, progression, and death by tumor subtype and evaluated differential risks using log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by type and extent of invasion. Among 62 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 22 of 29 patients with base extensive invasion progressed while 4 of 13 with base focal and 0 of 20 with stalk only invasion progressed. There was strong evidence that base extensive patients had higher risk of progression and death due to bladder cancer than base focal or stalk only counterparts (P<0.0001).

Similar findings in two other brothers suggested strongly that they were all suffering from an X linked recessive thrombocytopenic disorder. Results of DNA analysis with the probe M27 beta are consistent with X linkage and indicate also that the locus of the relevant gene lies close to or is identical to the locus of the gene for the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). Because of various features which include the presence of large and normal sized platelets (rather than small platelets) and freedom from significant immune deficiencies, it is likely that the X linked recessive thrombocytopenia in this family is an isolated entity quite distinct from the classical WAS phenotype.

Multi-class and binary classification using Machine Learning (ML) and regularization algorithms using iterative and univariate feature selection methods, including InfoGain, mRMR, ANOVA, and Chi Square, were used to uncover genomic markers associated with AD response. Relevant genes were selected based on Jaccard distance and carried forward for gene-network analysis. Linear association methods uncovered only one gene associated with drug treatment response. The implementation of ML algorithms, together with feature reduction methods, revealed a set of 204 genes associated with SSRI and 241 genes associated with NRI response. Although only 10% of genes overlapped across the two drugs, network analysis shows that both drugs modulated the CREB pathway, through different molecular mechanisms.

With the growing interest in reducing the environmental impact of human activities, the need to consider how to include environmental outcomes into HTAs has increased. We present a simple method of doing so. We adapted an existing clinical - economic model to include environmental outcomes (carbon dioxide [CO2] emissions) to predict the consequences of adding insulin to an oral antidiabetic (OAD) regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over 30 years, from the United Kingdom payer perspective. Epidemiological, efficacy, healthcare costs, utility, and carbon emissions data were derived from published literature. A scenario analysis was performed to explore the impact of parameter uncertainty. The addition of insulin to an OAD regimen increases costs by 2,668 British pounds per patient and is associated with 0.36 additional quality-adjusted life-years per patient. The insulin - OAD combination regimen generates more treatment and disease management - related CO2 emissions per patient (1,686 kg) than the OAD -only regimen (310 kg), but generates fewer emissions associated with treating complications (3,019", "target": "ENVIRONMENTAL|C0014406 ; OUTCOMES|C0086749 ; HEALTH|C0018684 ; ECONOMIC MODEL|C0013554 ; economic evaluations|C0150099 ; health technology assessments|C0039423 ; HTAs|C0039423 ; environmental|C0014406 ; outcomes|C0086749 ; reducing|C0392756 ; environmental impact|C0282165 ; human activities|C0020115 ; environmental|C0014406 ; outcomes|C0086749 ; HTAs|C0039423 ; increased|C0205217 ; clinical|C0205210 ; economic model|C0013554 ; environmental|C0014406 ; outcomes|C0086749 ; carbon dioxide|C0007012 ; CO2|C0007012 ; emissions|C2349995 ; predict|C0681842 ; consequences of|C0686907 ; insulin|C0021641 ; oral|C0442027 ; antidiabetic|C0935929 ; OAD|C0935929 ; regimen|C0040808 ; patients|C0030705 ; type 2 diabetes mellitus|C0011860 ; T2DM|C0011860 ; years|C0439234 ; United Kingdom|C0041700 ; payer|C2348942 ; Epidemiological|C0002783 ; efficacy|C1707887 ; healthcare costs|C0085552 ; carbon|C0007012 ; emissions|C2349995 ; data|C1511726 ; derived|C1441547 ; published literature|C0023866 ; scenario|C0683579 ; analysis|C0936012 ; performed|C0884358 ; impact|C4049986 ; parameter|C0549193 ; uncertainty|C0087130 ; insulin|C0021641 ; OAD|C0935929 ; regimen|C0040808 ; increases|C0442805 ; costs|C0010186 ; patient|C0030705 ; associated with|C0332281 ; additional|C1524062 ; quality-adjusted life-years|C0080071 ; patient|C0030705 ; insulin|C0021641 ; OAD|C0935929 ; combination|C0205195 ; regimen|C0040808 ; treatment|C0039798 ; disease management|C0376636 ; related|C0439849 ; CO2|C0007012 ; emissions|C2349995 ; patient|C0030705 ; OAD|C0935929 ; regimen|C0040808 ; emissions|C2349995 ; associated with|C0332281 ; treating|C1522326 ; complications|C0009566", "doc_id": "medmentions_28065172", "dataset": "EL"}

We used ecoacoustics to noninvasively assess the species richness of various biotopes typical of an ecofriendly forest plantation with diverse ecological gradients and both nonnative and indigenous vegetation. The reference area was an adjacent large World Heritage Site protected area (PA). All sites were in a global biodiversity hotspot. Our results showed how taxa segregated into various biotopes. We identified 65 singing species, including birds, frogs, crickets, and katydids. Large, natural, protected grassland sites in the PA had the highest mean acoustic diversity (14.1 species / site). Areas covered in nonnative timber or grass species were devoid of acoustic species.

The impaired wound healing of diabetic wounds is attributed to low levels of endogenous growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that normally stimulate multiple phases of wound healing. In this study, chitosan scaffolds were prepared via freeze drying and loaded with plasmid DNA encoding perlecan domain I and VEGF189 and analyzed in vivo for their ability to promote dermal wound healing. The plasmid DNA encoding perlecan domain I and VEGF189 loaded scaffolds promoted dermal wound healing in normal and diabetic rats. This treatment resulted in an increase in the number of blood vessels and sub-epithelial connective tissue matrix components within the wound beds compared to wounds treated with chitosan scaffolds containing control DNA or wounded controls.

In this study, we fabricated prevascularized synthetic device ports to help mitigate this limitation. Membranes with rectilinear arrays of square pores with widths ranging from 40 to 200 \u03bcm were created using materials (50 \u03bcm thick double-sided polished silicon) and processes (photolithography and directed reactive ion etching) common in the manufacturing of microfabricated sensors. Vascular endothelial cells responded to membrane geometry by either forming vascular tubes that extended through the pore or completely filling membrane pores after 4 days in culture. Although tube formation began to predominate overgrowth around 75 \u03bcm and continued to increase at even larger pore sizes, tubes formed at these large pore sizes were not completely round and had relatively thin walls. Thus, the optimum range of pore size for prevascularization of these membranes was estimated to be 75-100 \u03bcm. This study lays the foundation for creating a prevascularized port that can be used to reduce fibrous encapsulation and thus enhance diffusion to implanted medical devices and sensors. \u00a9 2015 Wiley", "target": "Prevascularized|C0042382 ; silicon|C0037114 ; membranes|C1706182 ; enhancement|C2349975 ; transport|C1705822 ; implanted medical devices|C2828363 ; drug delivery|C0085104 ; sensing devices|C0183210 ; in situ|C0444498 ; applications|C0185125 ; limited|C0439801 ; diffusion|C0012222 ; foreign body response|C1708386 ; fibrous|C0439709 ; encapsulation|C2348438 ; prevascularized|C0042382 ; synthetic device ports|C1706409 ; mitigate|C1553901 ; limitation|C0449295 ; Membranes|C1706182 ; rectilinear arrays|C1254362 ; square|C0205120 ; pores|C1254362 ; widths|C0487742 ; materials|C0520510 ; thick|C1280412 ; double-sided|C1254362 ; polished silicon|C0037114 ; processes|C1522240 ; photolithography|C0599199 ; directed reactive ion etching|C1254366 ; manufacturing|C0870840 ; microfabricated sensors|C0183210 ; Vascular endothelial cells|C1257792 ; membrane geometry|C1706182 ; vascular tubes|C0005847 ; extended|C0231449 ; pore|C1254362 ; completely|C0205197 ; filling|C0441655 ; membrane|C1706182 ; pores|C1254362 ; culture|C1331092 ; tube formation|C0042382 ; predominate|C0332251 ; overgrowth|C1849265 ; increase|C0442805 ; larger|C0549177 ; pore sizes|C3829176 ; tubes formed|C0042382 ; large|C0549177 ; pore sizes|C3829176 ; completely|C0205197 ; round|C0332490 ; thin|C0205168 ; walls|C0442069 ; optimum|C2698651 ; range|C1514721 ; pore size|C3829176 ; prevascularization|C0042382 ; membranes|C1706182 ; estimated|C0750572 ; study|C2603343 ; prevascularized|C0042382 ; port|C1706409 ; fibrous|C0439709 ; encapsulation|C2348438 ; enhance|C2349975 ; diffusion|C0012222 ; implanted medical devices|C2828363 ; sensors|C0183210", "doc_id": "medmentions_26316050", "dataset": "EL"}

Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa-beta. Both, production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF-kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub-regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices. The effect of PDTC on status epilepticus-associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model. Treatment with 150 mg/kg PDTC before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%. Administration of 50 mg/kg PDTC (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate. In vehicle-treated rats, status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons.

Due to the complexity of the process, the investigation of the constituent profile during fermentation is difficult. Metabolomics, the comprehensive study of low molecular weight compounds in biological samples, is thought to be a promising strategy for deep understanding of the constituent contribution to food flavor characteristics. Therefore, metabolomics is suitable for the analysis of soy sauce fermentation. Unfortunately, only few and unrefined studies of soy sauce fermentation using metabolomics approach have been reported. Therefore, we investigated changes in low molecular weight hydrophilic and volatile compounds of soy sauce using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)- based non-targeted metabolic profiling.

In these environments, these bacteria have developed a large range of resistance strategies among which the capacity to form particular biofilm structures. The biofilm formation is one of the most ubiquitous adaptive response observed in prokaryotes to various stresses, such as those induced in the presence of toxic compounds. This study focused on the process of biofilm formation in three Thiomonas strains (CB1, CB2 and CB3) isolated from the same AMD. The results obtained here show that these bacteria are all capable of forming biofilms, but the architecture and the kinetics of formation of these biofilms differ depending on whether arsenite is present in the environment and from one strain to another. Indeed, two strains favoured biofilm formation, whereas one favoured motility in the presence of arsenite.

The goal of this study is to establish the role of Kir channels in flow - induced vasodilatation and to provide first insights into the mechanisms responsible for Kir signalling in this process. First, we establish that primary endothelial cells isolated from murine mesenteric arteries express functional Kir2.1 channels sensitive to shear stress. Then, using the Kir2.1(+/-) heterozygous mouse model, we establish that downregulation of Kir2.1 results in significant decrease in shear - activated Kir currents and inhibition of endothelium -dependent flow - induced vasodilatation (FIV) assayed in pressurized mesenteric arteries pre-constricted with endothelin-1. Deficiency in Kir2.1 also results in the loss of flow - induced phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt, as well as inhibition of NO generation.

Moreover, recent studies have indicated EMT also plays an important role in renal fibrosis. In the current study, glucose and angiotensin II promoted EMT in podocytes as well as changes in the cellular morphology of podocytes. A high concentration of glucose and angiotensin II also promoted podocyte movement and migration. Moreover, a high concentration of glucose and angiotensin II promoted TCF8 expression. Inhibiting TCF8 expression with siRNA reversed EMT in podocytes in the presence of a high concentration of glucose and angiotensin.

Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals.

Here, we studied whether similar mechanisms regulate the motility of breast cancer cells. While neutrophils and benign human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) form a single leading edge, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells possess multiple leading edges enriched with A3 adenosine receptors. Compared to HMEC, MDA-MB-231 cells overexpress the ectonucleotidases ENPP1 and CD73, which convert extracellular ATP released by the cells to adenosine that stimulates A3 receptors and promotes cell migration with frequent directional changes.

That apart, several endocrinal parameters of hyperandrogenism were also examined. Several correlation studies were determined to establish the role of Vitamin D as a cardiometabolic risk factor in PCOS. Results were expressed as mean\u00b1SD and were statistically analysed using SPSS software version 16, unpaired student's t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. We found lower levels of Vitamin D, which was statistically significant as compared to healthy controls. Hyperinsulinemia, rise in insulin resistance and marked dyslipidemia was observed in the present study. Another relevant finding was significant correlation of Vitamin D with insulin and Homeostatic Model of Assessment- Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR). Hypovitaminosis D was prevalent in PCOS.

The levels of ingroup favoritism were affected by categorization and inequality, and the level of ingroup favoritism changed over time, increasing or decreasing depending on the nature of the initial intergroup structure. We conclude by providing two explanations for this change: emergent norms, and changes to the intergroup situation produced by interaction. Our experiments confirm the value of studying the evolution of minimal group behavior, especially for explaining why low status groups act to preserve intergroup inequalities.", "target": "B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_27851791", "dataset": "NER"}

Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB) or gemcitabine (GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Experience is Instrumental in Tuning a Link Between Language and Cognition: Evidence from 6- to 7- Month-Old Infants ' Object Categorization At birth, infants not only prefer listening to human vocalizations, but also have begun to link these vocalizations to cognition: For infants as young as three months of age, listening to human language supports object categorization, a core cognitive capacity. This precocious link is initially broad: At 3 and 4 months, vocalizations of both humans and nonhuman primates support categorization. But by 6 months, infants have narrowed the link: Only human vocalizations support object categorization. Here we ask what guides infants as they tune their initially broad link to a more precise one, engaged only by the vocalizations of our species. Across three studies, we use a novel exposure paradigm to examine the effects of experience.

Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2), was recently identified as a light-driven Na(+) pump. However, few functional studies on NdR2 have been conducted to elucidate its mechanism of ion transport. By reconstituting NdR2 into liposomes, we proved that NdR2 functions as a light-driven Na(+) / H(+) pump. As Na(+) concentration increased, the dominant H(+) pump activity switched to the Na(+) pump activity at neutral pH. The inversion of pH change by the addition of CCCP at low Na(+) further suggested that the transport of Na(+) and H(+) should coexist in NdR2. By increasing H(+) concentration, the affinity for Na(+) lowered, which was indicated by an increase in KM from ~31mM at pH ~7.5, to ~74mM at pH ~6.5.

Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings, yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject. The subjects gene deletions were variable, ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions. The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice. CONCLUSIONS. The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity. The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons, including milder effects of the mouse gene defect, differences in muscle and retinal gene product, or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin. The ERG shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DMD and its milder allelic forms..", "target": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O", "doc_id": "ncbi_8258524", "dataset": "NER"}

Increasing evidence suggests that transmembrane water channels (aquaporins) evolved to play vital adaptive roles that mitigate the osmotic and oxidative stress problems of the developing oocytes, embryos and spermatozoa. In this chapter, we provide a short overview of the diversity of the aquaporin superfamily in teleosts, and summarize the findings that uncovered a highly specific molecular regulation of aquaporins during oogenesis and spermatogenesis.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Epistatic influence in tomato Ve1 - mediated resistance Resistance to Verticillium wilt disease is associated with the tomato Ve-locus; however, the individual functional roles of Ve1 and Ve2 in host plants remain controversial. As a first step towards Ve mutational analyses in planta, the Ve1 coding region from a resistant tomato near-isoline (cv. Craigella GCR218) was introduced into a susceptible near-isoline (cv. Craigella GCR26). 35S:Ve1 plants segregated into two distinct classes; roughly half were resistant and half were susceptible. Ve1 transcript levels were upregulated in both classes compared to wild-type plants, showing stable transgenic expression. Expression analysis of Ve2 revealed that mRNA levels were similar between 35S:Ve1 and wild-type tomatoes, demonstrating that Ve1 transgene introduction does not alter endogenous Ve2 expression. Overall, the results of this study confirm the functional role of Ve1 protein in resistance to the vascular fungal pathogen V. dahliae race 1 (Vd1), but suggest that a yet undefined factor exerts an epistatic influence on the Ve1 gene.

Toward this aim, Systems Toxicology entails the integration of in vitro and in vivo toxicity data with computational modeling. This evolving approach depends critically on data reliability and relevance, which in turn depends on the quality of experimental models and bioanalysis techniques used to generate toxicological data. Systems Toxicology involves the use of large-scale data streams (\"big data \"), such as those derived from omics measurements that require computational means for obtaining informative results. Thus, integrative analysis of multiple molecular measurements, particularly acquired by omics strategies, is a key approach in Systems Toxicology. In recent years, there have been significant advances centered on in vitro test systems and bioanalytical strategies, yet a frontier challenge concerns linking observed network perturbations to phenotypes, which will require understanding pathways and networks that give rise to adverse responses.

ILARIS should not be administered to any patients with known clinical hypersensitivity to ILARIS [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].\n 5.4 Immunizations\n Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ILARIS [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Since no data are available on either the efficacy or on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ILARIS, live vaccines should not be given concurrently with ILARIS. In addition, because ILARIS may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccinations may not be effective in patients receiving ILARIS.

The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear. The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats.

Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it.

The recent isolation of the complete open reading frame of the choroideremia (CHM) gene and the characterization of the exon-intron boundaries has paved the way to mutation detection in patients with classical choroideremia. We have performed mutation screening in patients from 15 Danish and Swedish families by using Southern blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique. Causative mutations in the CHM gene were detected in at least 12 families, indicating that a substantial part of the mutations can be identified by this approach. In four of these families deletions of different sizes were found. Thus, in one patient, the deletion resulted in the absence of only one exon, while in another the deletion comprised the entire CHM gene. Mapping of the deletion endpoints in these four patients and in another 11 male patients with sizeable deletions enabled us to construct a very detailed map of intervals 2 and 3 of Xq21. In the remaining 11 Danish and Swedish families at least 8 causative mutations were found by PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing.

These advantages, along with recent studies showing therapeutic benefits achieved using traditional intradermal injections in human cancer patients, suggest MN delivery might enhance cancer vaccines and immunotherapies.

The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only).

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Active diffusion and microtubule-based transport oppose myosin forces to position organelles in cells Even distribution of peroxisomes (POs) and lipid droplets (LDs) is critical to their role in lipid and reactive oxygen species homeostasis. How even distribution is achieved remains elusive, but diffusive motion and directed motility may play a role. Here we show that in the fungus Ustilago maydis ~95% of POs and LDs undergo diffusive motions. These movements require ATP and involve bidirectional early endosome motility, indicating that microtubule - associated membrane trafficking enhances diffusion of organelles. When early endosome transport is abolished, POs and LDs drift slowly towards the growing cell end. This pole-ward drift is facilitated by anterograde delivery of secretory cargo to the cell tip by myosin-5. Modelling reveals that microtubule-based directed transport and active diffusion support distribution, mobility and mixing of POs. In mammalian COS-7 cells, microtubules and F-actin also counteract each other to distribute POs.

The lookup table was then used to predict the probability of suicide risk for any new assessment. Based on the different lengths of history of physical illnesses, we developed six different models to predict suicide risk. We tested the performance of developed models to predict 90-day risk using historical data over differing time-periods ranging from 3 to 48 months. A total of 16,858 assessments from 7399 mental health patients with at least one risk assessment was used for the validation of the developed model. The performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The best predictive results were derived (AUC =0.71) using combined data across all time-periods, which significantly outperformed the clinical baseline derived from routine risk assessment (AUC =0.56). The proposed approach thus shows potential to be incorporated in the broader risk assessment processes used by clinicians.

Hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation (HPD; dopa-responsive dystonia, DRD) have been recently found to be caused by a genetic defect in the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) gene. In this study, we quantified the mRNA level of GCH1 in phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated mononuclear blood cells from one Japanese family that do not have a mutation in the coding region or splice junctions of the gene. The results showed that the amounts of the GCH1 mRNA were decreased to about 40% of the normal level in both patients and carriers. In addition, we found that the GCH1 mRNA was transcribed from only one allele, indicating that the other allele was in an inactive state. These results suggest that some novel mutations should exist on one of the alleles in some unknown region of the GCH1 gene, and may decrease the GCH1 mRNA causing the HPD/DRD symptoms..", "target": "hereditary progressive dystonia|C4316810 ; Hereditary progressive dystonia|C4316810 ; HPD|C4316810 ; dopa-responsive dystonia|C1851920 ; DRD|C1851920 ; genetic defect|C0950123 ; HPD|C4316810 ; DRD|C1851920", "doc_id": "ncbi_10403837", "dataset": "EL"}

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Recovery from alcohol dependence: Do smoking indicators predict abstinence? There is inconsistent evidence about the potential influence of smoking on recovery from alcohol dependence. Our study aimed at assessing the impact of smoking-behavior on relapse during a 12 months follow-up period following a detoxification in patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Three hundred Patients with AUD (74.9% smoking) were recruited from two inpatient detoxification units in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and their alcohol consumption was prospectively followed for 1 year. Data on different indicators of smoking behavior was gathered. Cox regression model was used to evaluate potential risk factors on time to relapse of alcohol consumption. Two hundred seventy-nine participants (n = 279) were included in the final analysis. Smoking increased the risk for alcohol relapse (hazard ratio = 3.962, 95% CI 1.582-9.921).

Because clear cell papillary cystadenoma is similar to renal cell carcinoma histologically, and because both occur as components of the von Hippel-Lindau disease complex, the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of mutations in the VHL gene. A somatic VHL gene mutation was detected in one of the two tumors by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694, resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3. As the VHL gene is believed to function as a tumor suppressor gene, VHL gene mutations may play a role in the initiation of tumorigenesis in sporadic cystadenomas of the epididymis.", "target": "papillary cystadenoma|C0010636 ; renal cell carcinoma|C1266044 ; von Hippel-Lindau disease|C0019562 ; VHL|C0019562 ; VHL|C0019562 ; tumors|C0027651 ; VHL|C0019562 ; tumor|C0027651 ; VHL|C0019562 ; cystadenomas of the epididymis|C0010633", "doc_id": "ncbi_8522307", "dataset": "EL"}

Results: The HR for prostate cancer according to the existence of diabetes was stratified by BMI in both age - and multivariable-adjusted models. In the population without diabetes, the HR for prostate cancer significantly increased as BMI increased beyond the reference range in a model adjusted for age and multiple variables; however, the increase in the HR was small. In the population with diabetes, the HR for prostate cancer significantly increased as BMI increased from < 18.5 kg/m(2) to within the reference range (18.5 to 22.9) in the multivariable-adjusted model. In addition, a marked decrease in HR in the population with BMI of < 18.5 kg/m(2) was seen compared to the reference or higher BMI population.

Here we show that Kif7 is required for normal T-cell development, despite the fact that T-cells lack primary cilia. Analysis of Kif7 - deficient thymus showed that Kif7 - deficiency increases the early CD44+ CD25+ CD4- CD8- thymocyte progenitor population but reduces differentiation to CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) cell. At the transition from DP to mature T-cell, Kif7 - deficiency selectively delayed maturation to the CD8 lineage. Expression of CD5, which correlates with TCR signal strength, was reduced on DP and mature CD4 and CD8 cells, as a result of thymocyte - intrinsic Kif7 - deficiency, and Kif7 - deficient T-cells from radiation chimeras activated less efficiently when stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in vitro.

The best results occurred where the toe of the salt water wedge is expected to be the closest to the coast under predevelopment conditions. Predictions were the poorest for aquifers where the salt water wedge was expected to extend further inland under predevelopment conditions and was therefore more dispersive prior to pumping.

Five focus groups were conducted with multidisciplinary professionals to investigate their perspectives about, and approaches to, working with individuals with ASD and SA.

The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity).

To this end, whether EE2 exposure reduces male attractiveness to female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, was investigated by showing females video images of exposed and unexposed males.

We find that each ALK inhibitor is associated with a distinct spectrum of ALK resistance mutations and that the frequency of one mutation, ALK(G1202R), increases significantly after treatment with second-generation agents. To investigate strategies to overcome resistance to second-generation ALK inhibitors, we examine the activity of the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib in a series of ceritinib - resistant, patient -derived cell lines, and observe that the presence of ALK resistance mutations is highly predictive for sensitivity to lorlatinib, whereas those cell lines without ALK mutations are resistant.

Patients were excluded if they had renal failure (n = 15) or died during index admission (n = 38). Severity of AKI was defined using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN).

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Application of an Analytical Solution as a Screening Tool for Sea Water Intrusion Sea water intrusion into aquifers is problematic in many coastal areas. The physics and chemistry of this issue are complex, and sea water intrusion remains challenging to quantify. Simple assessment tools like analytical models offer advantages of rapid application, but their applicability to field situations is unclear. This study examines the reliability of a popular sharp-interface analytical approach for estimating the extent of sea water in a homogeneous coastal aquifer subjected to pumping and regional flow effects and under steady-state conditions. The analytical model is tested against observations from Canada, the United States, and Australia to assess its utility as an initial approximation of sea water extent for the purposes of rapid groundwater management decision making. The occurrence of sea water intrusion resulting in increased salinity at pumping wells was correctly predicted in approximately 60% of cases. Application of a correction to account for dispersion did not markedly improve the results. Failure of the analytical model to provide correct predictions can be attributed to mismatches between its simplifying assumptions and more complex field settings. The best results occurred where the toe of the salt water wedge is expected to be the closest to the coast under predevelopment conditions.

We found significant main effects and an interaction between time and exercise type for gait speed, with an early decline in the combined exercise group, as well as significant main effects of time, showing a functional decline in grip strength, one-leg standing time and step/height ratio in both exercise types at the 5- year follow up. The 5- year changes in each parameter did not differ between the two groups despite the frequency of exercise, even though we found a negative correlation between changes in one-leg standing time and total amount of water-based exercise.

However, very limited knowledge exists at the molecular and cellular level to target CSCs for prevention of cancer metastasis. In this study, we examined the roles of contractile dynamics of CSCs in cell invasion and delineated the underlying molecular mechanisms of their distinct cell invasion potential. Using de-adhesion assay and atomic force microscopy, we show that CSCs derived from melanoma and breast cancer cell lines exhibit increased contractility compared to non-CSCs across all tumor types. In addition, CSCs possess increased ECM remodeling capacity as quantified by collagen degradation assay. More importantly, pharmacological blockade of Rho-associated protein kinase completely abolished the contractility and collagen degradation capacity of both CSCs and non-CSCs.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Influence of climatic factors on the flight activity of the stingless bee Partamona orizabaensis and its competition behavior at food sources Stingless bee s have evolved several ways to share contested resources to ensure the coexistence between different species. Partamona orizabaensis quickly exploits food sources by fast and direct recruitment that does not rely on scent marks deposited on substrates. In this study we show that the flight activity of P. orizabaensis is influenced by weather conditions, with higher activity during periods of colder temperatures, higher relative humidity and even during rainfall. We showed that the outcome of aggression experiments between the non-aggressive species P. orizabaensis and its aggressive competitor Trigona fuscipennis is influenced by the number of bees that arrive early after food source discovery. Therefore, the increased activity during less favorable weather conditions and the fast recruitment of nestmates following the discovery of a food source, as observed for P. orizabaensis, may be adaptations that evolved to coexist even with more aggressive and dominant species of stingless bees, with which P. orizabaensis has to compete for resources.", "target": "B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_27431445", "dataset": "NER"}

Previous research has attempted to determine whether ingroup favoritism is produced by categorization or intragroup interdependencies (reciprocation expectations), but recent literature suggests that it is not possible to tease these influences apart. We report two studies that investigate how ingroup favoritism evolves over time in social interaction. The levels of ingroup favoritism were affected by categorization and inequality, and the level of ingroup favoritism changed over time, increasing or decreasing depending on the nature of the initial intergroup structure. We conclude by providing two explanations for this change: emergent norms, and changes to the intergroup situation produced by interaction.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential significance of strength of biofilm formation by clinical bovine mastitis -associated S. aureus in mammary tissue damage by using a mouse mastitis model. Two S. aureus strains of the same capsular phenotype with different biofilm forming strengths were used to non-invasively infect mammary glands of lactating mice. Biofilm forming potential of these strains were determined by tissue culture plate method, ica typing and virulence gene profile per detection by PCR. Delivery of the infectious dose of S. aureus was directly through the teat lactiferous duct without invasive scraping of the teat surface. Both bacteriological and histological methods were used for analysis of mammary gland pathology of mice post - infection.

Both galactosemia mutations result in reduced enzymatic activity when reconstructed in the cDNA and overexpressed. The polymorphism, in contrast, has near normal activity. Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues, suggesting that they are functionally important, while the polymorphism occurs in a nonconserved domain which is presumably not critical for enzymatic function.

The first cryoenergy application was performed in close proximity to the position during isolation of the left superior pulmonary vein (PV). Sequential overlapping freezes were applied along the left atrial (LA) roof by slight clockwise rotation of the sheath in combination with slight retraction of the sheath and incremental advancement of the cryoballoon, until reaching the original position for right superior PV isolation. The acute endpoint was the creation of a roofline, defined as complete conduction block across the LA roof >120 ms and ascending activation across the posterior LA wall. Acute success in roofline generation was achieved in 88% of patients, applying on average five (median 4-6) freezes with nadir temperature of -40\u00b0C (-36 to -44\u00b0C). In five patients, conduction block could not be achieved. No phrenic nerve injuries occurred during roofline generation.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER>  For the estimates of pets which may provoke problems in managing a veterinary or zoonotic disease we reviewed the literature and defined a comprehensive suite of ownership classes for cats and dogs, collated estimates of the sub-populations for each ownership class as well as their rates of interaction and produced a coherent scaled description of the structure of the national population. The predicted density of pets varied substantially, with the lowest densities in rural areas, and the highest in the centres of large cities where each species could exceed 2500 animals .km-2. Conversely, the number of pets per household showed the opposite relationship. Both qualitative and quantitative validation support key assumptions in the model structure and suggest the model is useful at predicting the populations of cats at geographical scales important for decision-making, although it also indicates where further research may improve model performance. In the event of an animal health crisis, it appears that almost all dogs could be brought under control rapidly. For cats, a substantial and unknown number might never be bought under control and would be less likely to receive veterinary support to facilitate surveillance and disease management; we estimate this to be at least 1.5 million cats.

BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients.

The four heme groups are highly solvent-exposed and the heme iron is hexa-coordinated with bis-His ligation by histidines from different monomers. Static light scattering confirmed the octameric assembly in solution, but a mutation of the heme - coordinating histidine caused dissociation into dimers. Isothermal titration calorimetry using the PduOC apoprotein showed strong heme binding (K d = 1.6 \u00d7 10(-7) M).

Imaging analyses with magnetic resonance scan showed diffuse atrophy in the frontoparietal regions. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified a heterozygous T to C transition at position 695 (c.695T>C) of in presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1), resulting in a novel missense mutation at codon 232 from leucine to proline (L232P). Several family members of the patient developed dementia, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance; however, we were unable to perform a segregation analysis to confirm this.

An auxiliary beta (1) -subunit, widely expressed in excitable tissues, shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na (+) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform. Here, we characterize the altered effects of a human beta (1) -subunit (hbeta (1)) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation (T1620M) previously associated with IVF.

We investigated how treatment with high dose of atorvastatin affects the impaired vascular function in diabetic rats. Atorvastatin (80mg/kg/day, oral gavage, 4 weeks) or its vehicle was administered to male control or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Aortic segments were used to investigate the vascular reactivity, protein expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) 1 (NOX1) and superoxide anions levels. Atorvastatin treatment did not affect glycemia levels.

The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone.

The molecular origin of fibrin's strain-stiffening behavior remains poorly understood, primarily because plasma fibrinogen is a complex mixture of heterogeneous molecular variants and is often contaminated by plasma factors that affect clot properties. Objectives and methods To facilitate mechanistic dissection of fibrin nonlinear elasticity, we produced a homogeneous recombinant fibrinogen corresponding to the main variant in human plasma, termed rFib610. We characterized the structure of rFib610 clots using turbidimetry, microscopy and X-ray scattering. We used rheology to measure the strain-stiffening behavior of the clots and determined the fiber properties by modeling the clots as semi-flexible polymer networks. Results We show that addition of FXIII to rFib610 clots causes a dose-dependent stiffness increase at small deformations and renders the strain-stiffening response reversible. We find that \u03b3-chain cross-linking contributes to clot elasticity by changing the force-extension behavior of the protofibrils, whereas \u03b1-chain cross-linking stiffens the fibers, as a consequence of tighter coupling between the constituent protofibrils. Interestingly, rFib610 protofibrils have a 25% larger bending rigidity than plasma -purified", "target": "blood clots|C0302148 ; molecular|C1521991 ; fibrin's|C0015982 ; strain-stiffening|C0013764 ; plasma|C0032105 ; fibrinogen|C0016006 ; complex|C1704241 ; mixture|C0439962 ; heterogeneous|C0019409 ; molecular|C1521991 ; variants|C0205419 ; plasma factors|C0033684 ; clot|C3156338 ; properties|C0871161 ; mechanistic dissection|C0205245 ; fibrin|C0015982 ; nonlinear elasticity|C0013764 ; homogeneous|C1881065 ; recombinant|C0034861 ; fibrinogen|C0016006 ; variant|C0205419 ; human|C0086418 ; plasma|C0032105 ; rFib610|C0016006 ; structure|C0678594 ; rFib610|C0016006 ; clots|C3156338 ; turbidimetry|C0041394 ; microscopy|C0026018 ; X-ray scattering|C0043301 ; rheology|C0599706 ; measure|C0079809 ; strain-stiffening|C0013764 ; clots|C3156338 ; fiber|C1304649 ; properties|C0871161 ; modeling|C0870071 ; clots|C3156338 ; semi-flexible polymer networks|C1882071 ; FXIII|C0015528 ; rFib610|C0016006 ; clots|C3156338 ; dose-dependent stiffness|C0018599 ; deformations|C0333067 ; strain-stiffening|C0013764 ; \u03b3-chain|C0033684 ; cross-linking|C0314675 ; clot|C3156338 ; elasticity|C0013764 ; force-extension behavior|C0205245 ; protofibrils|C0015982 ; \u03b1-chain|C0033684 ; cross-linking|C0314675 ; fibers|C1304649 ; tighter coupling|C1948027 ; protofibrils|C0015982 ; rFib610|C0016006 ; protofibrils|C0015982 ; bending rigidity|C0018599 ; plasma|C0032105", "doc_id": "medmentions_28166607", "dataset": "EL"}

In this protocol we describe a well-developed reverse genetic platform strategy for CoVs that is comprised of partitioning the viral genome into 5-7 independent DNA fragments (depending on the CoV genome), each subcloned into a plasmid for increased stability and ease of genetic manipulation and amplification. Coronavirus genomes are conveniently partitioned by introducing type IIS or IIG restriction enzyme recognition sites that confer directional cloning. Since each restriction site leaves a unique overhang between adjoining fragments, reconstruction of the full-length genome can be achieved through a standard DNA ligation comprised of equal molar ratios of each fragment. Using this method, recombinant CoVs can be rapidly generated and used to investigate host range, gene function, pathogenesis, and candidate therapeutics for emerging and preemergent CoVs both in vitro and in vivo.", "target": "plasticity|C0678558 ; genetic changes|C1705285 ; mutated|C1513776 ; fragments|C1704681 ; genome stability|C1257825 ; time|C0040223 ; protocol|C2348563 ; reverse genetic platform|C1657306 ; CoVs|C0010076 ; partitioning|C0332849 ; viral genome|C0042720 ; DNA fragments|C0684192 ; CoV|C0010076 ; genome|C0017428 ; subcloned|C0598888 ; plasmid|C0032136 ; increased|C0205217 ; stability|C1257825 ; genetic manipulation|C0178659 ; amplification|C0017256 ; Coronavirus|C0010076 ; genomes|C0017428 ; partitioned|C0332849 ; type IIS|C0012906 ; IIG restriction enzyme|C0012906 ; recognition sites|C1882940 ; directional cloning|C0598888 ; restriction site|C1882940 ; fragments|C1704681 ; reconstruction of the full-length genome|C0017387 ; DNA ligation|C1155649 ; fragment|C0486805 ; method|C0025663 ; recombinant CoVs|C0597363 ; rapidly generated|C3146294 ; host range|C2936413 ; gene function|C0314627 ; pathogenesis|C0699748 ; candidate|C0743153 ; therapeutics|C0087111 ; emerging|C0750573 ; preemergent|C0750573 ; CoVs|C0010076 ; in vitro|C1533691 ; in vivo|C1515655", "doc_id": "medmentions_28508214", "dataset": "EL"}

Furthermore, the cation-to-anion permeability ratio of the mutant is much greater than that of the wild-type channel. Voltage-dependent blocks by intracellular and extracellular iodide help to distinguish two distinct ion binding sites within the hClC-1 conduction pathway. Both binding sites are preserved in the mutant but have decreased affinities for iodide.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of haematological, renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in tumour-bearing dogs receiving 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU). DESIGN: The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with CCNU at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 206 dogs treated with CCNU, 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity. CCNU was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma, mast cell tumour, brain tumour, histiocytic tumours and epitheliotropic lymphoma.

BACKGROUND: Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol (CPA/EE) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with CPA/EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives (COCs). We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA/EE. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA/EE versus conventional COCs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-3.58].

No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events was observed. The CAPS clinical studies employed the biosensor binding assay, and most of the SJIA clinical studies employed the bridging assay. The data obtained in an assay are highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, underlying disease, and the number of patients tested.

We analysed 150 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, who received intramyocardial CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or CABG alone. The mortality rate, major adverse cerebral and cardiac events, and functional outcome parameters were evaluated for the time period up to 14 years follow-up. As a result, we have stratified the patient population (96 patients) into responders and non-responders. Furthermore, the analysis of relevant predictors of good response to CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment was performed. Several positive tendencies related to stem cells transplantation were demonstrated.

We aimed to explore barriers to access and uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-positive men who have sex with men in Hanoi. During 2015, we conducted qualitative interviews with 35 participants recruited using snowball sampling based on previous research and social networks. Key individual impediments to ART uptake included inadequate preparation for a positive diagnosis and the dual stigmatisation of homosexuality and HIV and its consequences, leading to fear of disclosure of HIV status. Health system barriers included lack of clarity and consistency about how to register for and access ART, failure to protect patient confidentiality and a reticence by providers to discuss sexual identity and same-sex issues.

The mean exposure across studies was 12 months. In ATHENA, the maximum follow-up was 30 months.\n In clinical trials, premature discontinuation because of adverse reactions occurred in 11.8% of the dronedarone-treated patients and in 7.7% of the placebo-treated group. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with MULTAQ were gastrointestinal disorders (3.2 % versus 1.8% in the placebo group) and QT prolongation (1.5% versus 0.5% in the placebo group).\n The most frequent adverse reactions observed with MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily in the 5 studies were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and asthenia.\n Table 1 displays adverse reactions more common with dronedarone 400 mg twice daily than with placebo in AF or AFL patients, presented by system organ class and by decreasing order of frequency.

The mechanism how this single mutation causes Flaviviridae viruses to escape nucleoside analogues is not yet known.

Implementing a stochastic molecular software showed the all-atom 2'-C-methylated analogue reaction within the active sites of wild type and serine-threonine mutant polymerases from Hepacivirus and Flavivirus. Compared with the wild type, the serine-threonine mutant polymerases caused a significant decrease of analogue contacts with conserved interrogating residues in motif F and a displacement of metal ion cofactors. The simulations significantly showed that during the analogue exploration of the active site the hydrophobic methyl group in the serine-threonine mutant repels water -mediated hydrogen bonds with the 2'-C-methylated analogue, causing a concentration of bonds at the substrate - interacting sites.

However, the cognitive role of the alERC is poorly understood. Previous human studies treat the alERC as an extension of the neighboring perirhinal cortex, supporting object memory. Animal studies suggest that the alERC may support the spatial properties of objects. In a group of older adult humans at the earliest stages of cognitive decline, we show that alERC volume selectively predicted configural processing (attention to the spatial arrangement of an object's parts). This is the first study to demonstrate a cognitive role related to alERC volume in humans.

Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination. Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar.

All Gram-negative bacteria contain complex glycoconjugates anchored to their outer membranes, but in most strains of C. jejuni, this lipoglycan lacks the O-antigen repeating units. Recent mass spectrometry analyses indicate that the C. jejuni 81116 (Penner serotype HS:6) lipoglycan contains two dideoxyhexosamine residues, and enzymological assay data show that this bacterial strain can synthesize both dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-glucose and dTDP-3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose.

This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats.

Among them, 87 genes were up-regulated, and 66 genes were notably down-regulated.

The present study identified genes profiling in the liver tissue of E. granulosus infection in sheep.

Using a photoreactive amino acid incorporated into proteins, we show that in live cells, cell extracts, and in vitro reconstituted complexes, Hexim1 cross-links and thus contacts Cdk9.

Reciprocally, Hexim1 is cross-linked by a photoreactive amino acid replacing Cdk9 W193, a tryptophan within this activation segment. These findings provide evidence of a direct interaction between Cdk9 and its inhibitor, Hexim1. Based on similarities with Cdk2 3D structure, the Cdk9 peptide cross-linked by Hexim1 corresponds to the substrate binding-site.

Thus, PR inhibitors (PIs) are the most effective class of anti-HIV drugs. However, the main challenge to the successful use of PI drugs in patient treatment is the emergence of multidrug resistant PRs (mdrPRs). This study aimed to develop a fission yeast cell-based system for rapid testing of new PIs that combat mdrPRs. Three mdrPRs were isolated from HIV-infected patients that carried seven (M7PR), ten (M10PR) and eleven (M11PR) PR gene mutations, respectively. They were cloned and expressed in fission yeast under an inducible promoter to allow the measurement of PR -specific proteolysis and drug resistance. The results showed that all three mdrPRs maintained their abilities to proteolyze HIV viral substrates (MA \u2193 CA and p6) and to confer drug resistance. Production of these proteins in the fission yeast caused cell growth inhibition, oxidative stress and altered mitochondrial morphologies that led to cell death.

Cancer is dynamic, heterogeneous, evolving with the TME and can be influenced by tissue-specific elasticity. One of the mediators and modulators of the crosstalk between CSCs and mechanical forces is miRNA, which can be developmentally regulated, tissue- and cell-specific. Here, based on our previous data, we provide a framework through which such gene expression changes in response to external mechanical forces can be understood during cancer progression. Recognizing the ways mechanical forces regulate and affect intracellular signals has applications in cancer stem cell biology. Such TME - targeted pathways shed new light on attacking cancer stem cells with fewer side effects than traditional gene-based treatments for cancer, requiring a \u201c watch-and-wait\u201d approach.

In the present study, we propose to overcome these limitations and enhance the therapeutic effects of scopolamine via administration in combination with the group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor antagonist, LY341495. Joint administration of sub-effective doses of scopolamine (0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) with a sub-effective dose of LY341495 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a profound antidepressant effect in the tail suspension test (TST) and in the forced swim test (FST) in mice.

The identified exo-chitinase mainly produced N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, using chitin as a substrate by submerged fermentation. The A. parvus HANDI 309 biofuels producing exo-chitinase were characterized by TLC, and was further validated and quantified by HPLC. Furthermore, the optimal temperature and pH for the exo-chitinase activity was obtained in the culture conditions of 30 \u00b0C and 7.0, respectively. The maximum growth of the stationary phase was reached in 24 h after incubation. These results suggest that A. parvus HANDI 309 biofuels producing exo-chitinases may have great potential in chitin to N-acetyl-d-glucosamine conversion. The excellent thermostability and hydrolytic properties may give the exo-chitinase great potential in chitin to GlcNAc conversion in industry.

The design was a prospective study with blinded measurements. The sample constituted 10 complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients who underwent NAM therapy by the same operator. Direct extra and intra oral anthropometric measurements were done using a digital vernier caliper before and after NAM therapy. A photographic evaluation was also done to rate the nasal deformity post NAM therapy. The differences between measurements were statistically analyzed using paired t tests. The extra oral measurements revealed a statistically significant increase in bi-alar width, columellar length and width. The intraoral measurements demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in anterior alveolar cleft width.

Parous women who breastfed for at least one year had a 31% lower risk of TNBC than parous women who had never breastfed (odds ratio, OR = 0.69; 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.50-0.96). The association between breastfeeding and risk of TNBC was modified by age and race.

In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer; thus, in addition to six cases of gastric cancer, a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years. We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations. However, only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations. Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers, and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer.

Previous studies have indicated an association between annexin A1 (ANXA1) and neuronal cell apoptosis, and RGCs apoptosis in acute ischemia-reperfusion was attributed to an increased production of IL-1\u03b2. We found that the expression and nuclear translocation of ANXA1 were upregulated in models of acute ischemia-reperfusion in RGCs in vivo.

Of all respondents, 77 % reported physical complaints directly attributable to the use of laparoscopic instruments. No evident similarity in the main preference for graspers was found, either with or without haptic feedback. According to respondents, the added value of haptic feedback could be of particular use in feeling differences in tissue consistencies, feeling the applied pressure, locating a tumor or enlarged lymph node, feeling arterial pulse, and limiting strain in the surgeon's hand. This study stresses that the high prevalence of physical complaints directly related to laparoscopic instruments among laparoscopic surgeons is still relevant.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> MicroRNA-18a-5p functions as an oncogene by directly targeting IRF2 in lung cancer Lung cancer is the major form of cancer resulting in cancer-related mortality around the world. MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding single-stranded RNAs, which can engage in the regulation of gene expression. In this study, miR-18a-5p significantly upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and NSCLC cell lines, suggesting an oncogenic function in lung cancer. Additionally, miR-18a-5p can promote carcinogenesis by directly targeting interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2). Further experiments indicated that IRF2 can increase cell apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation and migration ability. Our study demonstrates that miR-18a-5p promotes autophagy in NSCLC. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-18a-5p can not only promote NSCLC by suppressing IRF2, but also will be a promising target in the near future.", "target": "B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_28471447", "dataset": "NER"}

Enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA), known as the most common form of inner ear abnormality, has recently been of particular genetic interest because this anomaly is inherited in a recessive manner.

In the present study, seven mutations in the PDS gene (PDS), the gene responsible for Pendred syndrome, have been found in families of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA. One family is homozygous, three families are compound heterozygotes, and two families are heterozygous but with no other mutation detected.

A majority of these participants reported having problems specifically related to failures with selective attention. Envelope following responses (EFRs) measuring neural coding fidelity of the auditory brainstem to suprathreshold sounds were similar between blast-exposed and non-blast controls. Blast-exposed subjects performed substantially worse than non-blast controls in an auditory selective attention task in which listeners classified the melodic contour (rising, falling, or \" zig-zagging \") of one of three simultaneous, competing tone sequences. Salient pitch and spatial differences made for easy segregation of the three concurrent melodies. Poor performance in the blast-exposed subjects was associated with weaker evoked response potentials (ERPs) in frontal EEG channels, as well as a failure of attention to enhance the neural responses evoked by a sequence when it was the target compared to when it was a distractor. These results suggest that communication problems in these listeners cannot be explained by compromised sensory representations in the auditory periphery, but rather point to lingering blast-induced damage to cortical networks implicated in the control of attention.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in homozygous affected individuals. Heterozygotes for the gene for A-T are thought to comprise about 1% of the general population and, therefore, it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers. Heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with A-T, although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test. For this reason, we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with A-T to that expected in a random sample of the general population. There were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75, compared to 42. 6 expected (p less than 0. 02).

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Connect: A Novel Volunteer Program for Hospitalized Patients with IBD and Their Families Patients with inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) often require hospitalization and this experience is stressful. Health care providers frequently do not have adequate time to address the emotional impact of the hospitalization on the patient and family. Nonmedical support for inpatients was identified as an unmet need by a Crohn's disease patient's family. This led to the development of a volunteer peer specialist network, IBD Connect, where peer volunteers visit hospitalized patients with IBD to offer emotional support and educational materials. We aimed to determine the feasibility of incorporating IBD Connect into an inpatient IBD service, evaluate the impact of IBD Connect on patients' willingness to share their disease experience with family and friends, and improve stress. Since the inception of IBD Connect in 2012, peer volunteers have made 1469 total visits to 677 unique inpatients.

Age of onset (AO) of Huntington disease (HD) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, in turn, is known to influence AO in Alzheimer disease, rendering the APOE gene a likely candidate to affect AO in other neurological diseases too. We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length. Genotyping for APOE was performed blind to clinical information. In addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon AO in maternally inherited HD and in male patients, we show that the APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier AO in males than in females. Such a sex difference in AO was not apparent for any of the other APOE genotypes.

Due to the complexity of the process, the investigation of the constituent profile during fermentation is difficult. Metabolomics, the comprehensive study of low molecular weight compounds in biological samples, is thought to be a promising strategy for deep understanding of the constituent contribution to food flavor characteristics. Therefore, metabolomics is suitable for the analysis of soy sauce fermentation. Unfortunately, only few and unrefined studies of soy sauce fermentation using metabolomics approach have been reported. Therefore, we investigated changes in low molecular weight hydrophilic and volatile compounds of soy sauce using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)- based non-targeted metabolic profiling. The data were analyzed by statistical analysis to evaluate influences of yeast and lactic acid bacterium on the constituent profile.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder for which the biochemical defect is as yet unknown.

Both of these cloned segments were described as tightly linked to the locus and were capable of detecting deletions in the DNA of boys affected with DMD. In an attempt to determine more precisely the occurrence of these deletions within a large population of DMD patients and the accuracy of one of the segments, DXS164 (pERT87), in determining the inheritance of the DMD X chromosome, the subclones 1, 8 and 15 were made available to many investigators throughout the world. Here we describe the combined results of more than 20 research laboratories with respect to the occurrence of deletions at the DXS164 locus in DNA samples isolated from patients with DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).

METHODS: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data. Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded. RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine.

Possible risks of extremely low levels Following the continuous accumulation of evidence supporting the beneficial role of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, therapeutic possibilities now exist to lower LDL-C to very low levels, similar to or even lower than those seen in newborns and nonhuman species. In addition to the important task of evaluating potential side effects of such treatments, the question arises whether extremely low LDL-C levels per se may provoke adverse effects in humans. In this review, we summarize information from studies of human cellular and organ physiology, phenotypic characterization of rare genetic diseases of lipid metabolism, and experience from clinical trials. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of the robustness of the regulatory systems that maintain balanced fluxes and levels of cholesterol at both cellular and organismal levels. Even at extremely low LDL-C levels, critical capacities of steroid hormone and bile acid production are preserved, and the presence of a cholesterol blood-brain barrier protects cells in the central nervous system. Apparent relationships sometimes reported between less pronounced low LDL-C levels and disease states such as cancer, depression, infectious disease and others can generally be explained as secondary phenomena.

About 98% of mutant alleles have an expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene. This leads to reduced levels of the protein, frataxin. There is mounting evidence to suggest that Friedreich ataxia is the result of accumulation of iron in mitochondria leading to excess production of free radicals, which then results in cellular damage and death.

Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy.

Seligman and Maier (1967) theorized that animals learned that outcomes were independent of their responses -that nothing they did mattered-and that this learning undermined trying to escape. The mechanism of learned helplessness is now very well-charted biologically, and the original theory got it backward. Passivity in response to shock is not learned. It is the default, unlearned response to prolonged aversive events and it is mediated by the serotonergic activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus, which in turn inhibits escape. This passivity can be overcome by learning control, with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex, which subserves the detection of control leading to the automatic inhibition of the dorsal raphe nucleus. So animals learn that they can control aversive events, but the passive failure to learn to escape is an unlearned reaction to prolonged aversive stimulation. In addition, alterations of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex - dorsal raphe pathway can come to subserve the expectation of control.

This paper proposes a multi-label predictor based on ensemble linear neighborhood propagation (LNP), namely, LNP-Chlo, which leverages hybrid sequence-based feature information from both labeled and unlabeled proteins for predicting localization of both single- and multi-label chloroplast proteins. Experimental results on a stringent benchmark dataset and a novel independent dataset suggest that LNP-Chlo performs at least 6% (absolute) better than state-of-the-art predictors. This paper also demonstrates that ensemble LNP significantly outperforms LNP based on individual features.

Mutations in KLHL3 cause constitutively increased renal salt reabsorption and impaired K(+) secretion, resulting in hypertension and hyperkalemia. Although clinical studies have shown that dietary K(+) intake affects blood pressure, the mechanisms have been obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the KLHL3 ubiquitin ligase complex is involved in the low- K(+) -mediated activation of Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) in the kidney. In the distal convoluted tubules of mice eating a low-K(+) diet, we found increased KLHL3 phosphorylation at S433 (KLHL3(S433-P)), a modification that impairs WNK binding, and also reduced total KLHL3 levels.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Expression and Purification of E2 Glycoprotein from Insect Cells (Sf9) for Use in Serology Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito - borne arbovirus which poses a major threat to global public health. Definitive CHIKV diagnosis is crucial, especially in distinguishing the disease from dengue virus, which co-circulates in endemic areas and shares the same mosquito vectors. Laboratory diagnosis is mainly based on serological or molecular approaches. The E2 glycoprotein is a good candidate for serological diagnosis since it is the immunodominant antigen during the course of infection, and reacts with seropositive CHIKV sera.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> S-Nitrosylation Induces Structural and Dynamical Changes in a Rhodanese Family Protein S-Nitrosylation is well established as an important post-translational regulator in protein function and signaling. However, relatively little is known about its structural and dynamical consequences. We have investigated the effects of S-nitrosylation on the rhodanese domain of the Escherichia coli integral membrane protein YgaP by NMR, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. The results show that the active cysteine in the rhodanese domain of YgaP is subjected to two competing modifications: S-nitrosylation and S-sulfhydration, which are naturally occurring in vivo. It has been observed that in addition to inhibition of the sulfur transfer activity, S-nitrosylation of the active site residue Cys63 causes an increase in slow motion and a displacement of helix 5 due to a weakening of the interaction between the active site and the helix dipole.

All had myofibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate. In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up-regulation of MHC-I expression even in non-necrotic fibres. Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of prednisolone and methotrexate, and in one case spontaneously. These observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune-mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy.

Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery.", "target": "ketamine|C0022614 ; ketamine|C0022614 ; ketamine|C0022614 ; depression|C0282126 ; depression|C0282126 ; ketamine|C0022614 ; tachycardia|C0039231 ; ketamine|C0022614", "doc_id": "cdr_921394", "dataset": "EL"}

In this article, I highlight four areas of progress: processes of selection into teenage motherhood, the broader consequences of teenage childbearing beyond the socioeconomic realm, heterogeneity of effects, and the application of life course principles. Emerging societal trends such as complex family structures, a stalled recovery from the recession for families of low socioeconomic status, and a rapidly evolving political environment for reproductive health care continue to challenge the lives of teenage mothers. Given that the consequences for teenagers of becoming mothers may change, continued research is needed.

BACKGROUND: In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis.

The advent of diagnostic criteria for AE attempts to facilitate its prompt identification but risks prematurely neglecting the potential scientific and clinical significance of isolated syndromes that do not satisfy these criteria. Here, we propose using a syndrome - level taxonomy that has occasional, but not necessary, overlap with AE: synaptic and neuronal autoantibody - associated psychiatric syndromes or \" SNAps \". This will prevent confusion with AE and act heuristically to promote active investigation into this rare example of psychopathology defined on a molecular level. We suggest that this concept would have application in other autoantibody - associated syndromes including seizure, cognitive, and movement disorders, in which similar issues arise. We review putative direct and indirect mechanisms and outline experimentally testable hypotheses that would help to determine prospectively in whom autoantibody detection is relevant, and as important, in whom it is not. We summarize a pragmatic approach to autoantibody testing and management in severe mental illness in order to promptly diagnose AE and advocate a research - orientated experimental medicine paradigm for SNAps, where there is greater equipoise.

In this paper we investigate the mechanisms leading to directional particle expulsion during shape oscillations of particle - coated bubbles driven by ultrasound at 40 kHz. We perform high-speed visualisation of the interface shape and of the particle distribution during ultrafast deformation at a rate of up to 10(4) s(-1). The mode of shape oscillations is found to not depend on the bubble size, in contrast with what has been reported for uncoated bubbles. A decomposition of the non-spherical shape in spatial Fourier modes reveals that the interplay of different modes determines the locations of particle expulsion. The n-fold symmetry of the dominant mode does not always lead to desorption from all 2n antinodes, but only those where there is favourable alignment with the sub-dominant modes. Desorption from the antinodes of the shape oscillations is due to different, concurrent mechanisms. The radial acceleration of the interface at the antinodes can be up to 10(5)-10(6) ms(-2), hence there is a contribution from the inertia of the particles localised at the antinodes.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Twenty miles per hour speed limits: a sustainable solution to public health problems in Wales Prevention, rather than treatment, is the key to longer healthier lives. Identifying interventions that will impact positively on road traffic injuries, air quality and encourage active travel is a significant public health challenge. This paper aimed to explore whether 20 mph limits could be useful in achieving this. Research evidence was reviewed to identify the effect of 20 mph zones and limits on health and well-being. The evidence was then used to estimate the effect of a change to a 20 mph limit on road traffic casualties and air pollution. It was then mapped against the seven goals of the Well-being of Future Generations Act (2015). If all current 30 mph limit roads in Wales became 20 mph limits, it is estimated that 6-10 lives would be saved and 1200-2000 casualties avoided each year, at a value of prevention of \u00a358M-\u00a394M. In terms of air pollution, deaths attributed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) may increase by 63, and years of life lost by 753. However, deaths attributed to particulates (PM2.5) may decrease by 117 and years of life lost by 1400.

Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness and characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goitre.

PDS encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin.

The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial PGE2, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor.

Photon upconverting particles (UCPs) can bridge this gap as they are excited by NIR light but emit in the visible range via an anti-Stokes luminescence mechanism. Here, two different UCPs have been identified, high- efficiency micro (540)- UCPs and lower efficiency nano (545)- UCPs, that respond to NIR light and emit visible light with high photostability even at very high NIR power densities (>25 000 Suns). Both of these UCPs can be rapidly and reversibly excited by visible and NIR light and emit light at visible wavelengths detectable with standard emission settings used for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a commonly used genetically encoded fluorophore.", "target": "Nanoparticles|C1450053 ; High-Resolution|C1719039 ; Coalignment|C1706765 ; Near-Infrared|C1289901 ; Visible Light|C0242377 ; Light Microscope|C0491970 ; near-infrared|C1289901 ; NIR|C1289901 ; visible wavelengths|C0242377 ; light microscopy|C0430389 ; biological studies|C0005507 ; biology|C0005532 ; NIR|C1289901 ; optogenetics|C3494301 ; NIR laser|C1289901 ; gene expression|C0017262 ; protein function|C1527118 ; technical barrier|C1710348 ; NIR|C1289901 ; visible light|C0242377 ; optical microscope|C0026018 ; coalignment|C1706765 ; imaging plane position|C1254362 ; Photon|C0086805 ; upconverting particles|C0597177 ; UCPs|C0597177 ; gap|C3887622 ; excited|C0549255 ; NIR light|C1289901 ; emit|C0596835 ; visible range|C0242377 ; anti-Stokes luminescence mechanism|C4054591 ; UCPs|C0597177 ; efficiency|C0013682 ; micro|C3811161 ; UCPs|C0597177 ; efficiency|C0013682 ; nano|C1553036 ; UCPs|C0597177 ; NIR light|C1289901 ; visible light|C0242377 ; photostability|C0205360 ; NIR|C1289901 ; UCPs|C0597177 ; excited|C0549255 ; visible|C0242377 ; NIR light|C1289901 ; emit light|C0596835 ; visible wavelengths|C0242377 ; emission|C0596835 ; Green Fluorescent Protein|C0120285 ; GFP|C0120285 ; genetically encoded|C0314627 ; fluorophore|C0598447", "doc_id": "medmentions_28221018", "dataset": "EL"}

Before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg. Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control. Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control. Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control. No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon. CONCLUSION: During dobutamine stress testing, metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia.

Background Well documented deficits in sagittal plane knee loading, during dynamic tasks indicate individuals limit the magnitude of knee loading following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It is unknown how these individuals modulate the speed of knee flexion during loading, which is particularly important as they progress to running during rehabilitation. Objective To investigate how individuals following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction perform dynamic knee loading tasks compared to healthy controls. Methods Two groups of recreationally active individuals participated; 15 healthy controls (CTRL) and 15 post-ACLR (ACLR). Participants performed 3 trials of over-ground running (RUN) and a single limb loading (SLL) task. Sagittal plane range of motion, peak knee extensor moment, peak knee flexion angular velocity, peak knee power absorption, and rate of knee extensor moment were calculated during deceleration. Mixed-factor multivariate analysis of variance was performed to compare differences in variables between groups (ACLR and CTRL), limbs (within ACLR) and tasks (within CTRL).

However, the endophytic microbiome in this plant is poorly defined. Endophytic bacteria play a role in supplying plants with the basic requirements necessary for growth and development. Moreover, these bacteria also play a role in the mechanism of salinity stress adaptation in plants. As a prelude to the isolation and utilization of these bacteria in Caliph medic farming, 41 bacterial OTUs were identified in this project from within the interior of the roots of this plant by pyrosequencing of the small ribosomal subunit gene (16S rDNA) using a cultivation-independent approach. In addition, the differential abundance of these bacteria was studied following exposure of the plants to salinity stress. About 29,064 high-quality reads were obtained from the sequencing of six libraries prepared from control and salinity-treated tissues.

This study examined the impact of the four stages of internalized stigma on recovery orientation and assessed cognitive insight as a moderator. Data from a community sample of adults with serious mental illness (N = 268) were collected through structured interviews. Regression -based analyses were used to examine the main effects of internalized stigma on recovery orientation and the moderating effect of cognitive insight. Applying stigmatizing beliefs to oneself and the related decrement in self-esteem each predicted decreased recovery orientation. Cognitive insight moderated the effect of self-application of stigmatizing beliefs on recovery orientation. Increasing cognitive insight by fostering flexibility in self-cognitions may help reduce internalized stigma. Interventions may also benefit from addressing the emotional component of internalized stigma, such as feelings of shame.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Modelling the influence of temperature and rainfall on malaria incidence in four endemic provinces of Zambia using semiparametric Poisson regression Although malaria morbidity and mortality are greatly reduced globally owing to great control efforts, the disease remains the main contributor. In Zambia, all provinces are malaria endemic. However, the transmission intensities vary mainly depending on environmental factors as they interact with the vectors. Generally in Africa, possibly due to the varying perspectives and methods used, there is variation on the relative importance of malaria risk determinants. In Zambia, the role climatic factors play on malaria case rates has not been determined in combination of space and time using robust methods in modelling. This is critical considering the reversal in malaria reduction after the year 2010 and the variation by transmission zones.

AIM: The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of \"meth mouth\" and the medical risks associated with this serious condition. BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertension, hallucinations, and violent behavior. Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene, xerostomia, rampant caries (\"meth mouth\"), and excessive tooth wear. Oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challenging. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dental pain, bad breath, and self-reported poor esthetics. A comprehensive examination including her medical history, panoramic radiograph, and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions, which is not very common for a healthy adult. She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the drug.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Differential regulation of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in somatosensory cortex by retinoic acid Retinoic acid (RA), a developmental morphogen, has emerged in recent studies as a novel synaptic signaling molecule that acts in mature hippocampal neurons to modulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the context of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. However, it is unclear whether RA is capable of modulating neural circuits outside of the hippocampus, and if so, whether the mode of RA's action at synapses is similar to that within the hippocampal network. Here we explore for the first time RA 's synaptic function outside the hippocampus and uncover a novel function of all-trans retinoic acid at inhibitory synapses. Acute RA treatment increases spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex, and this effect requires expression of RA's receptor RAR\u03b1 both pre- and post-synaptically. Intriguingly, RA does not seem to affect evoked inhibitory transmission assayed with either extracellular stimulation or direct activation of action potentials in presynaptic interneurons at connected pairs of interneurons and pyramidal neurons.

Lung ultrasound and blood gas were performed before, 2 hours (H2) and 24 hours (H24) after drainage of pleural effusion. Lung ultrasound aeration score was calculated. Cephalocaudal dimension and diaphragmatic transversal area of lung consolidation were measured. Ten patients were studied. Median volume of drained effusion was 675 ml at H2 and 895 at H24. Two hours after drainage, dimension of cephalocaudal consolidation and diaphragmatic transversal area decreased significantly. Lung reaeration after drainage occurred mainly in latero-inferior and postero-superior regions. PaO2/FiO2 increased significantly at H24. Ultrasound is a useful method to assess lung consolidation after pleural effusion drainage.

The human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunit gene (CHRNA4) is located in the candidate region for three different phenotypes  benign familial neonatal convulsions, autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and low-voltage EEG. Recently, a missense mutation in transmembrane domain 2 of CHRNA4 was found to be associated with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy in one extended pedigree. We have determined the genomic organization of CHRNA4, which consists of six exons distributed over approximately 17 kb of genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequence obtained from the genomic regions adjacent to the exon boundaries enabled us to develop a set of primer pairs for PCR amplification of the complete coding region. The sequence analysis provides the basis for a comprehensive mutation screening of CHRNA4 in the above-mentioned phenotypes and possibly in other types of idiopathic epilepsies..", "target": "benign familial neonatal convulsions|C0220669 ; autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy|C0393671 ; autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy|C0393671 ; idiopathic epilepsies|C0086237", "doc_id": "ncbi_8833159", "dataset": "EL"}

We used SSCP to analyze an amplified genomic DNA fragment containing exon 12 from seven individuals with Kniest dysplasia. An abnormality was identified in one patient. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the patient was heterozygous for a G to A transition that implied substitution of glycine103 of the triple helical domain by aspartate.

To improve the efficacy of pharmacological treatments, targeted drug delivery by means of polymer nanoparticles is a challenging but, at the same time, efficient strategy. Thanks to a highly multidisciplinary approach, several ways to overcome the brain protection have provided effective solutions to treat a large number of diseases. Important advances in polymer science, together with the development of novel techniques for nanocarrier preparation, and the discovery of novel targeting ligands and molecules, allow a fine-tuning of size, shape, chemicophysical properties and surface chemistry of functional particulate systems; it enables the improvement of the therapeutic performances for several drugs, also toward districts that are difficult to be treated, such as the brain.

In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a consistent t (2; 13) (q35; q14) or variant t (1; 13) (p36; q14) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins, respectively. In this report, we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression. Furthermore, PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms. Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process. In contrast, PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification. Thus, gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, presumably due to differences in", "target": "O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O", "doc_id": "ncbi_9223312", "dataset": "NER"}

Acute RA treatment increases spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex, and this effect requires expression of RA's receptor RAR\u03b1 both pre- and post-synaptically. Intriguingly, RA does not seem to affect evoked inhibitory transmission assayed with either extracellular stimulation or direct activation of action potentials in presynaptic interneurons at connected pairs of interneurons and pyramidal neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that RA's action at synapses is not monotonous, but is diverse depending on the type of synaptic connection (excitatory versus inhibitory) and circuit (hippocampal versus cortical). Thus, synaptic signaling of RA may mediate multi-faceted regulation of synaptic plasticity. In addition to its classic roles in brain development, retinoic acid (RA) has recently been shown to regulate excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the adult brain.

In this study, a number of image contrast enhancement algorithms which are based on fuzzy logic were applied to liver ultrasound images - in which the view of kidney is observable - using Matlab2013b to improve the image contrast and quality which has a fuzzy definition; just like image contrast improvement algorithms using a fuzzy intensification operator, contrast improvement algorithms applying fuzzy image histogram hyperbolization, and contrast improvement algorithms by fuzzy IF-THEN rules.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Synchronous vitellogenin expression and sexual maturation during migration are negatively correlated with juvenile hormone levels in Mythimna separata Annual migration of pests between different seasonal habitats can lead to serious crop damage. Reproductive immaturity is generally associated with the migratory process (oogenesis - flight syndrome), but the mechanism of reproductive development during migration varies unpredictably. Here, the vitellogenin gene (MsVg) and three key regulatory enzyme genes (MsJhamt, MsJheh and MsJhe) related to juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and degradation were identified and characterized in Mythimna separata. The relative expression of MsVg varied significantly in response to seasonal changes and was significantly correlated with stages of ovarian development.

However, the in vivo fate and clearance of CPS has never been thoroughly investigated. Here, we injected mice with purified CPS intravenously and determined CPS concentrations in serum, urine, and major organs at various intervals. The results indicate that CPS is predominantly eliminated through urine and no CPS accumulation occurs in the major organs. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that intact CPS was excreted through urine. To understand how a large molecule like CPS was eliminated without degradation, a 3-dimenational structure of CPS was modeled. The predicted CPS structure has a rod-like shape with a small diameter that could allow it to flow through the glomerulus of the kidney. CPS clearance was determined using exponential decay models and the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. The results show that CPS has a relatively short serum half-life of 2.9 to 4.4 hours.

Recent studies have shown that MALAT1 plays an important role in many malignancies. However, little is known about the role of MALAT1 in glioma. In this study, we determined the expression of MALAT1 and explored its prognostic value in glioma. Further, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of MALAT1 in glioma progression. Our results showed that the expression of MALAT1 was significantly decreased in glioma specimens than in noncancerous brain tissues. In addition, MALAT1 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size, WHO grade and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and was an independent prognostic factor for survival of glioma patients.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Perfusion Angiography in Acute Ischemic Stroke Visualization and quantification of blood flow are essential for the diagnosis and treatment evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases. For rapid imaging of the cerebrovasculature, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard as it offers high spatial resolution. This paper lays out a methodological framework, named perfusion angiography, for the quantitative analysis and visualization of blood flow parameters from DSA images. The parameters, including cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time-to-peak (TTP), and T max, are computed using a bolus tracking method based on the deconvolution of the time-density curve on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The method is tested on 66 acute ischemic stroke patients treated with thrombectomy and/or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and also evaluated on an estimation task with known ground truth. This novel imaging tool provides unique insights into flow mechanisms that cannot be observed directly in DSA sequences and might be used to evaluate the impact of endovascular interventions more precisely.", "target": "B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O", "doc_id": "medmentions_27446232", "dataset": "NER"}

We further report the first evidence for pulsatile transcriptional repression of a glucocorticoid - target gene in vivo, with pulsatile regulation of Pomc transcription in pituitary. We have explored a potential mechanism for differences in the induction dynamics of the same transcript (Sgk1) between the PFC and pituitary. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation profiles were strikingly different in pituitary and prefrontal cortex, with a significantly greater dynamic range and shorter duration of GR activity detected in the pituitary, consistent with the more pronounced gene pulsing effect observed.

For flexibility in generating stable cell lines the sgRNAs have been cloned in a lentivirus backbone containing PiggyBac transposase recognition elements together with fluorescent and drug selection markers. Over 95% of tested sgRNA induced specific DNA cleavage as measured by CEL-1 assays. Furthermore, sgRNA targeting GPI anchor protein pathway genes induced loss of function mutations in human and mouse cell lines measured by FLAER labelling.

Scutellarin (SCU), a flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Erigeron breviscapus, has been widely accepted as an antioxidant, but the effect of SCU on vasospasm after SAH remains elusive. Endovascular perforation was conducted to induce SAH in Sprague-Dawley rats.

Indeed, first-order lateral roots of plants growing on slope condition showed an asymmetric distribution between up- and down-slope. Contrarily, this asymmetric distribution was not observed in plants growing in plane. The tensile strength was higher in lateral roots growing up-slope and in plane conditions than in those growing down-slope. Anatomical investigations revealed that, while roots grown up-slope had higher area covered by xylem fibers, the ratio of xylem and phloem fibers to root diameter did not differ among the three conditions, as also, no differences were found for xylem fiber cell wall thickness. Roots growing up-slope were the main contributors to anchorage properties, which included higher strength and higher number of fibers in the xylematic tissues.

For insects, many habitat patches harbour ' resident ' species that are present as larvae (sedentary) and adults (winged and dispersing), and ' itinerant ' species present only as adults that have dispersed from elsewhere and fail to reproduce. We tested whether itinerancy patterns were temporally consistent, and whether itinerant and resident species differed in wing morphology, a strong correlate of flight capability. Over 3 years and at multiple locations in a 22 km stream length, we sampled larvae and adults of caddisflies in the genus Ecnomus to categorize species as residents or itinerants.

They are important members of microbial communities that catalyze the biomining of sulfidic ores, thereby solubilizing metal ions. These microorganisms live under extremely acidic and metal -loaded environments and thus must tolerate high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is a cobalt -containing tetrapyrrole cofactor involved in intramolecular rearrangement reactions and has recently been suggested to be an intracellular antioxidant. In this work, we investigated the effect of the exogenous addition of cobalamin on oxidative stress parameters in Leptospirillum group II strain CF-1. Our results revealed that the external supplementation of cobalamin reduces the levels of intracellular ROSs and the damage to biomolecules, and also stimulates the growth and survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress exerted by ferric ion, hydrogen peroxide, chromate and diamide.

Several model parameters necessary for computer simulation were determined by reviewing and analyzing available published experimental data. By comparing experimental data to computer modelling results, we identify the parameters that are the most sensitive to the measured system properties and allow for the best data fitting. Our model allows extraction of parameters from experimental data and also has predictive power. Using the model we describe interesting time - dependent quantities that were not directly measured in the experiment and identify correlations among the fitted parameter values. Numerical simulation of viral infection progression is done by a rate - equation approach resulting in a system of \"stiff\" equations, which are solved by using a novel variant of the stochastic ensemble modelling approach.

There was no significant difference between microstructure parameters calculated on low - dose SIR and standard - dose FBP images. However, the results revealed a strong dependency on the regularization strength applied during SIR. It was observed that stronger regularization might corrupt the microstructure analysis, because the trabecular structure is a very small detail that might get lost during the regularization process.

Genetic defects of CreaT lead to mental retardation with seizures. The present study explored the regulation of CreaT by the ubiquitously expressed glycogen synthase kinase GSK3\u00df, which contributes to the regulation of neuroexcitation. GSK3\u00df is phosphorylated and thus inhibited by PKB/Akt. Moreover, GSK3\u00df is inhibited by the antidepressant lithium.

We show that pauses in dopamine neuron firing, evoked by either stimulation of GABAergic input s or hyperpolarizing current injections, are enhanced by a subclass of potassium conductances that are recruited at voltages below spike threshold. Importantly, A-type potassium currents recorded in mesoaccumbal neurons displayed substantially slower inactivation kinetics, which, combined with weaker expression of hyperpolarization - activated currents, lengthened hyperpolarization -induced delays in spiking relative to nigrostriatal neurons. These results suggest that input integration differs among dopamine neurons favoring higher sensitivity to inhibition in mesoaccumbal neurons and may partially explain in vivo observations that ventral tegmental area neurons exhibit longer aversive pauses relative to SNc neurons.", "target": "O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_28219982", "dataset": "NER"}

The biomechanical modeling step is carefully analyzed and leads to the description of the flow governed by the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid.

We describe a novel approach for the detection of aggregates in the size range 1 to 1000 \u03bcm combining fluorescent dyes for protein aggregate labelling and automated fluorescence microscope imaging (aFMI). After appropriate selection of the dye and method optimization, our method enabled us to detect various types of HMW species of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Using 10 \u03bcmol L(-1) 4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonate (Bis-ANS) in combination with aFMI allowed the analysis of mAb aggregates induced by different stresses occurring during downstream processing, storage, and administration.

Alstrom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, early-onset obesity, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Pair-wise analyses resulted in maximum lod (logarithm of the odds ratio) scores of 3. 84 and 2. 9, respectively. To confirm these findings, a large linkage study was performed in twelve additional families segregating for Alstrom syndrome. A maximum two-point lod score of 7. 13 (theta = 0. 00) for marker D2S2110 and a maximum cumulative multipoint lod score of 9. 16 for marker D2S2110 were observed, further supporting linkage to chromosome 2p13.

The findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in the SN. As a result, dopamine release and content, as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen. Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group.

Artefacts are reduced and CT -like HUs are recovered in the artefact corrected CBCT images. Visual inspection confirms that artefacts are indeed suppressed by the proposed method, and the HU root mean square difference between reconstructed CBCTs and the reference CT images are reduced by 31% when using the artefact corrections compared to the standard clinical CBCT reconstruction.

Its anti-allodynic effects required cannabinoid (CB)1 and CB2 receptors; however, only CB2 receptors were necessary for the anti-edematous effects in the carrageenan assay. Although high doses of SA-57 alone were required to produce antinociception, low doses of this compound, which elevated AEA and did not affect 2-AG brain levels, augmented the antinociceptive effects of morphine, but lacked cannabimimetic side effects. Because of the high abuse liability of opioids and implication of the endocannabinoid system in the reinforcing effects of opioids, the final experiment tested whether SA-57 would alter heroin seeking behavior.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Mechanisms of iPS cell generation and beyond The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) achieved by overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, transformed our classical views of the cellular epigenetic landscape and delivered a new concept for cell and tissue engineering. In addition to iPSCs, several other cell types have also been generated by master transcription factor (TF)-mediated transdifferentiation. However, the critical molecular mechanisms amongst diverse cellular identity changes are not well understood. Through the investigation of reprogramming mechanisms, we recently revealed that over-expression of constitutive active Smad3 boosted not only iPSC generation, but also 3 other master TF -mediated conversions, from B cells to macrophages, myoblasts to adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons.

Their important differences regarding their outcome and the fact of being increasingly often identified has put a special focus on these neoplasms by surgeons, pathologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists, and oncologists alike. Management of patients with PCNs can be challenging and varies considerably among the various subtypes of PCNs. Their treatment ranges from resection of malignant lesions, to resection and/or surveillance in the case of premalignant lesions, to simple observation in the case of benign or indolent lesions. Under these circumstances, the accurate classification of PCNs becomes crucial. Therapeutic decision making and classification rely mainly on the presenting symptoms and radiologic findings, often without actual histologic tissue.

Results of the PROMETRICS 2011 database To evaluate the possible association between bladder tumor location and the laterality of positive lymph nodes (LN) in a prospectively collected multi-institutional radical cystectomy (RC) series. The study population included 148 node-positive bladder cancer (BC) patients undergoing RC and pelvic lymph node dissection in 2011 without neoadjuvant chemotherapy and without distant metastasis. Tumor location was classified as right, left or bilateral and compared to the laterality of positive pelvic LN. A logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of ipsilaterality of lymphatic spread. Using multivariate Cox regression analyses (median follow-up: 25 months), the effect of the laterality of positive LN on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) was estimated. Overall, median 18.5 LN [interquartile range (IQR), 11-27] were removed and 3 LN (IQR 1-5) were positive.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Mapping how local perturbations influence systems-level brain dynamics The human brain exhibits a distinct spatiotemporal organization that supports brain function and can be manipulated via local brain stimulation. Such perturbations to local cortical dynamics are globally integrated by distinct neural systems. However, it remains unclear how local changes in neural activity affect large-scale system dynamics. Here, we briefly review empirical and computational studies addressing how localized perturbations affect brain activity. We then systematically analyze a model of large-scale brain dynamics, assessing how localized changes in brain activity at the different sites affect whole-brain dynamics. We find that local stimulation induces changes in brain activity that can be summarized by relatively smooth tuning curves, which relate a region's effectiveness as a stimulation site to its position within the cortical hierarchy. Our results also support the notion that brain hubs, operating in a slower regime, are more resilient to focal perturbations and critically contribute to maintain stability in global brain dynamics. In contrast, perturbations of peripheral regions, characterized by faster activity, have greater impact on functional connectivity. As a parallel with this region-level result, we also find that peripheral systems such as the visual and sensorimotor networks were more affected by local perturbations than high-level systems such as the cingulo-operc", "target": "B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O", "doc_id": "medmentions_28126550", "dataset": "NER"}

Gastrodin (GAS), the main constituent of a Chinese traditional herbal medicine named Gastrodia elata Blume, has been reported to be associated with neuroprotective properties. Besides, GAS activated MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways which are often involved in growth of nerve cells were also reported. Based on the hypothesis that GAS may have an effect on SCs growth, we studied the effect of GAS on rat RSC96 Schwann cells (SCs) and further explored the underlying mechanism. Various concentration of GAS (0\u03bcM, 50\u03bcM, 100\u03bcM, and 200\u03bcM) was used for treatment of RSC96 SCs, with the cell proliferation and gene expression of several neurotrophic factors to be detected.

Remarkably, anucleate platelets express the NF-\u03baB machinery, whose role in platelets remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of NF-\u03baB in the release of cytokines and serotonin by human platelets, following selective stimulation of TLR2 and protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a classical and non-classical pattern-recognition receptor, respectively, able to participate to the innate immune system. We discovered that platelet PAR1 activation drives the process of NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, in contrast to TLR2 activation, which induces a slower phosphorylation process. Conversely, platelet PAR1 and TLR2 activation induces similar ERK1/2, p38, and AKT phosphorylation.

Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively.

Immunocytochemistry on neurospheres showed increased Nestin expression and decreased Ki67 expression, which collectively indicated aberrant NPC biology. Intriguingly, flow cytometric analysis of the expression of the antigens CD15, CD24, CD133, GLAST, and PSA-NCAM showed a decreased proportion of neural stem cells (GLAST(+)CD15(+)CD133(+)) and an increased proportion of neuroblasts (PSA-NCAM(+)CD15(+)) in the DG of P7 Fmr1 - KO mice. This was mirrored by lower expression levels of Nestin and the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 in vivo in the P9 hippocampus, as well as a decreased proportion of cells in the G2/M phases of the P7 DG. Thus, the absence of FMRP leads to fewer actively cycling NPCs, coinciding with a decrease in neural stem cells and an increase in neuroblasts.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Modeling viscous dissipation during vocal fold contact: the influence of tissue viscosity and thickness with implications for hydration The mechanics of vocal fold contact during phonation is known to play a crucial role in both normal and pathological speech production, though the underlying physics is not well understood. Herein, a viscoelastic model of the stresses during vocal fold contact is developed. This model assumes the cover to be a poroelastic structure wherein interstitial fluid translocates in response to mechanical squeezing. The maximum interstitial fluid pressure is found to generally increase with decreasing viscous dissipation and/or decreasing tissue elasticity. A global minimum in the total contact stress, comprising interstitial fluid pressure and elastic stress in the tissue, is observed over the studied dimensionless parameter range. Interestingly, physiologically reasonable estimates for the governing parameters fall within this global minimum region. The model is validated against prior experimental and computational work, wherein the predicted contact stress magnitude and impact duration agree well with published results. Lastly, observations of the potential relationship between vocal fold hydration and increased risk of tissue damage are discussed based upon model predictions of stress as functions of cover layer thickness and viscosity.", "target": "B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_28004225", "dataset": "NER"}

Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01).

Comparison of teeth with and without visible enamel microcracks Our aim was to assess the possible changes in sensitivity of teeth with and without visible enamel microcracks (EMCs) up to 1 week after the removal of metal brackets. After debonding, 15 patients possessing teeth with visible EMCs and 15 subjects whose teeth were free of EMCs were enrolled in the study. For each experimental group, a control group was formed. The assessments of tooth sensitivity elicited by compressed air and cold testing were performed 5 times: just before debonding, immediately after debonding, and at 1, 3, and 7 days after debonding. Tooth sensitivity was recorded on a 100-mm visual analog scale. For the patients without visible EMCs, discomfort peaked immediately after debonding and started to decrease on day 1; at 1 week after debonding, the visual analog scale scores were lower than just before debonding and immediately after debonding.

Children were attentive and responsive in both conditions, but only children in the FaceTime group responded to the partner in a temporally synced manner. After one week, children in the FaceTime condition (but not the Video condition) preferred and recognized their Partner, learned more novel patterns, and the oldest children learned more novel words.

In this work, we study EEG -based directed functional networks in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To this end, directed connectivity matrices of 25 AD patients and 26 healthy subjects are processed and a number of neurophysiologically meaningful graph theory metrics are studied. Our data show that functional networks of AD brains have significantly reduced global connectivity in alpha and beta bands (P < 0.05). The AD brains have significantly higher local connectivity than healthy controls in alpha and beta bands. This decreased profile in global connectivity can be linked to compensatory increased local connectivity as a result of widespread decline in the long-range connections.

Claudin-6 (Cldn6) is a tetraspanin transmembrane protein found within the tight junctional complex and is implicated in maintaining lung epithelial barriers. To test the hypothesis that increased Cldn6 ameliorates inflammation at the respiratory barrier, we utilized the Tet-On inducible transgenic system to conditionally over-express Clnd6 in the distal lung.

We assessed whether tebanicline exerts an effect on various noxious stimuli and mediates the nicotine receptor or opioid receptor through stimulation. The antinociceptive effects of tebanicline were determined by noxious chemical, thermal and mechanical stimuli -induced behaviours in mice. Tebanicline had dose-dependent analgesic effects in formalin, hot-plate and tail-pressure tests. By contrast, the antinociceptive effect of tebanicline was not demonstrated in the tail-flick assay.

Those dosages (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73% and brain greater than or equal to 67% of control values produced severe (greater than or equal to 3) cervical cord pathology in 85% of the rats.

Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions.

Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis. Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate. However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities. There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder for which the biochemical defect is as yet unknown.

Both of these cloned segments were described as tightly linked to the locus and were capable of detecting deletions in the DNA of boys affected with DMD. In an attempt to determine more precisely the occurrence of these deletions within a large population of DMD patients and the accuracy of one of the segments, DXS164 (pERT87), in determining the inheritance of the DMD X chromosome, the subclones 1, 8 and 15 were made available to many investigators throughout the world. Here we describe the combined results of more than 20 research laboratories with respect to the occurrence of deletions at the DXS164 locus in DNA samples isolated from patients with DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Metabolic shift of the kynurenine pathway impairs alcohol and cocaine seeking and relapse The glutamatergic system plays a key role in the maintenance of drug use and development of drug-related conditioned behaviours. In particular, hyper-glutamatergic activity and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation may drive drug craving and relapse. Inhibition of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) shifts the metabolic kynurenine pathway towards production of kynurenic acid, which leads to a reduction of glutamatergic / NMDAR activity via different mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether drug-seeking and relapse behaviour could be modified by the metabolic shift of endogenous kynurenine pathway. An inhibitor of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) Ro61-8048 (4 and 40 mg/kg) and its prodrug JM6 (100 and 200 mg/kg) were tested in two behavioural rat models for drug seeking and relapse -the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long-term alcohol-drinking rats and the model of cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol- and cocaine-seeking behaviour.

However, the molecular mechanism of REM-sleep regulation by the OB is unknown. Adenosine promotes sleep and its A2A receptors (A2AR) are expressed in the OB. We hypothesized that A2AR in the OB regulate REM sleep. Bilateral microinjections of the A2AR antagonist SCH58261 into the rat OB increased REM sleep, whereas microinjections of the A2AR agonist CGS21680 decreased REM sleep. Similar to the A2AR antagonist, selective A2AR knockdown by adeno-associated virus carrying short-hairpin RNA for A2AR in the rat OB increased REM sleep.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Utility of Ward-Based Retinal Photography in Stroke Patients Improvements in acute care of stroke patients have decreased mortality, but survivors are still at increased risk of future vascular events and mitigation of this risk requires thorough assessment of the underlying factors leading to the stroke. The brain and eye share a common embryological origin and numerous similarities exist between the small vessels of the retina and brain. Recent population-based studies have demonstrated a close link between retina l vascular changes and stroke, suggesting that retinal photography could have utility in assessing underlying stroke risk factors and prognosis after stroke. Modern imaging equipment can facilitate precise measurement and monitoring of vascular features. However, use of this equipment is a challenge in the stroke ward setting as patients are frequently unable to maintain the required seated position, and pupil dilatation is often not feasible as it could potentially obscure important neurological signs of stroke progression. This small study investigated the utility of a novel handheld, nonmydriatic retinal camera in the stroke ward and explored associations between retinal vascular features and stroke risk factors.

At the cell level, a complex network of sarcolemmal invaginations, called the transverse-axial tubular system (TATS), propagates membrane potential changes to the cell core, ensuring synchronous and uniform excitation-contraction coupling. Although myocardial conduction of excitation has been widely described, the electrical properties of the TATS remain mostly unknown. Here, we exploit the formal analogy between diffusion and electrical conductivity to link the latter with the diffusional properties of TATS. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy is used to probe the diffusion properties of TATS in isolated rat cardiomyocytes: A fluorescent dextran inside TATS lumen is photobleached, and signal recovery by diffusion of unbleached dextran from the extracellular space is monitored. We designed a mathematical model to correlate the time constant of fluorescence recovery with the apparent diffusion coefficient of the fluorescent molecules.

As a result of maskless grayscale optical lithography followed by modified deep reactive ion etching and replica molding, we were able to accurately reproduce the fractal topography of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Characterisation using AFM at three different length scales revealed that the nano and micro-topographical features, in addition to the fractal dimension, of native ADM were reproduced in PDMS. In conclusion, it has been shown that the fractal topography of biological surfaces can be mimicked in synthetic materials using the novel fabrication process outlined, which may be applied to significantly enhance medical device biocompatibility and performance.", "target": "biomimetic properties|C0871161 ; method|C0025663 ; accurately|C0443131 ; reproducing|C0205245 ; micro|C0870781 ; nanoscale topography|C0870781 ; human|C0086418 ; biological tissue|C0457457 ; synthetic polymer|C0440257 ; fabrication process|C1254366 ; biological tissue|C0457457 ; surface|C0205148 ; characterised|C1880022 ; atomic force microscopy|C0242849 ; AFM|C0242849 ; spatial|C1254362 ; data|C1511726 ; grayscale 'digital photomask'|C2827989 ; maskless grayscale optical lithography|C0599199 ; modified deep reactive ion etching|C1254366 ; replica molding|C1254366 ; accurately|C0443131 ; fractal topography|C0870781 ; acellular dermal matrix|C3494272 ; ADM|C3494272 ; polydimethylsiloxane|C0137758 ; PDMS|C0137758 ; Characterisation|C1880022 ; AFM|C0242849 ; different|C1705242 ; length|C1444754 ; scales|C0183110 ; nano|C0870781 ; micro-topographical|C0870781 ; features|C2348519 ; fractal dimension|C0439534 ; native|C0302891 ; ADM|C3494272 ; reproduced|C0205245 ; PDMS|C0137758 ; fractal topography|C0870781 ; biological surfaces|C0205148 ; synthetic materials|C0440251 ; novel|C0205314 ; fabrication process|C1254366 ; medical device|C0025080 ; biocompatibility|C0596177 ; performance|C1882330", "doc_id": "medmentions_27454401", "dataset": "EL"}

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design, 40 healthy young adults completed a stimulus-response learning task on either levodopa or placebo. Half of the participants received 100mg of levodopa and 25mg of carbidopa whereas the other half received an equal volume of placebo. In Session 1, participants learned to associate abstract images with specific key-press responses through trial and error with outcome feedback. In Session 2, participants performed stimulus-specific selections to abstract images they had previously learned in Session 1. Participants treated with levodopa compared to those on placebo demonstrated unambiguously less efficient acquisition of stimulus-response associations. The groups did not differ in their ability to enact stimulus-specific selections once they were learned, however, even though these responses were not overlearned. This pattern of findings is entirely consistent with the effect of levodopa on cognition in PD. The deleterious effects of levodopa on learning seem independent of PD pathology.

In the present study, subject - specific culture collections were obtained from early plaque biofilm of two volunteers, and coaggregations within each culture collection were assayed. Coaggregations, several of which involved a coaggregation -mediating cell surface molecule known from well-studied streptococci, were widespread. Unexpectedly, the little-studied organisms Haemophilus and Rothia participated in the greatest numbers of interactions with community members; these two organisms showed different distributions within the undisturbed biofilm.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Recent coating developments for combination devices in orthopedic and dental applications: A literature review Orthopedic and dental implants have been used successfully for decades to replace or repair missing or damaged bones, joints, and teeth, thereby restoring patient function subsequent to disease or injury. However, although device success rates are generally high, patient outcomes are sometimes compromised due to device -related problems such as insufficient integration, local tissue inflammation, and infection. Many different types of surface coatings have been developed to address these shortcomings, including those that incorporate therapeutic agents to provide localized delivery to the surgical site. While these coatings hold enormous potential for improving device function, the list of requirements that an ideal combination coating must fulfill is extensive, and no single coating system today simultaneously addresses all of the criteria. Some of the primary challenges related to current coatings are non-optimal release kinetics, which most often are too rapid, the potential for inducing antibiotic resistance in target organisms, high susceptibility to mechanical abrasion and delamination, toxicity, difficult and expensive regulatory approval pathways, and high manufacturing costs.

In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1-hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by PEG treatment. Single parent expression (SPE) of genes is an extreme instance of gene expression complementation, in which genes are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In the present study, 1,997 genes only expressed in B73 and 2,024 genes only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded the number of active genes in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype - specific expression profiles. While on average 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to PEG treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype - specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit.

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two collagenases and effect of NAC on hepatocyte isolation from porcine liver tissue. Porcine hepatocytes were isolated using the perfusion method from Bama mini pigs assigned to the Serva NB 4 group (n=6), the Serva NB 8 group (n=6), or the NB 8 + NAC group (n=6). Viability and yield were defined as fresh hepatocytes and their spheroids formation after 24-hour rocker culture in serum-free medium.

BACKGROUND: Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. Teratology 4:15-24, 1971). There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Integrated Strategy Improves the Prediction Accuracy of miRNA in Large Dataset MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs of about 22 nucleotides, which play critical roles in gene expression regulation. The biogenesis of miRNAs is largely determined by the sequence and structural features of their parental RNA molecules. Based on these features, multiple computational tools have been developed to predict if RNA transcripts contain miRNAs or not. Although being very successful, these predictors started to face multiple challenges in recent years. Many predictors were optimized using datasets of hundreds of miRNA samples. The sizes of these datasets are much smaller than the number of known miRNAs. Consequently, the prediction accuracy of these predictors in large dataset becomes unknown and needs to be re-tested. In addition, many predictors were optimized for either high sensitivity or high specificity. These optimization strategies may bring in serious limitations in applications. Moreover, to meet continuously raised expectations on these computational tools, improving the prediction accuracy becomes extremely important. In this study, a meta-predictor mirMeta was developed by integrating a set of non-linear transformations with meta-strategy.

A new molecular lesion has been identified in exon 7 of the PAH gene in a Hungarian PKU patient by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA. The C-to-T transition causes the substitution of Arg243 to a termination codon, and the mutant allele is associated with haplotype 4 of the PAH gene. The mutation is present in two of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among Eastern Europeans and is not present among Western Europeans and Asians.

BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm.

{"task": "NER", "input": "<NER> Twenty miles per hour speed limits: a sustainable solution to public health problems in Wales Prevention, rather than treatment, is the key to longer healthier lives. Identifying interventions that will impact positively on road traffic injuries, air quality and encourage active travel is a significant public health challenge. This paper aimed to explore whether 20 mph limits could be useful in achieving this. Research evidence was reviewed to identify the effect of 20 mph zones and limits on health and well-being. The evidence was then used to estimate the effect of a change to a 20 mph limit on road traffic casualties and air pollution.

These advantages, along with recent studies showing therapeutic benefits achieved using traditional intradermal injections in human cancer patients, suggest MN delivery might enhance cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. We recently developed a new class of polyelectrolyte multilayers based on the self-assembly of model peptide antigens and molecular toll-like receptor agonists (TLRa) into ultrathin, conformal coatings. Here, we reasoned that these immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (iPEMs) might be a useful platform for assembling cancer vaccine components on MN arrays for intradermal delivery from these substrates.

A comparison is made between these two technologies in terms of infrastructure and maintenance, dosimetry, shielding requirements, staffing, costs, security, patient throughput and clinical use. Infrastructure and maintenance are more demanding for linacs due to the complex electric componentry. In dosimetry, a higher beam energy, modulated dose rate and smaller focal spot size mean that it is easier to create an optimised treatment with a linac for conformal dose coverage of the tumour while sparing healthy organs at risk. In shielding, the requirements for a concrete bunker are similar for cobalt-60 machines and linacs but extra shielding and protection from neutrons are required for linacs. Staffing levels can be higher for linacs and more staff training is required for linacs. Life cycle costs are higher for linacs, especially multi-energy linacs.

India is a home to about twenty million persons with diverse disabilities out of which about five million are persons with visual impairments. Diversity of passenger movements on a railway station including persons with visual impairments requires a Universal Design approach to respond to the accessibility issues in these contexts. This research study is based on a series of live on-site experiences conducted along with persons with visual impairments at New Delhi Railway Station. It also includes the generic studies carried out with other diversities of railway passengers including aging, gender and diverse physical abilities. It employs research methods like ethnography, focus group interactions and trace study to develop a deeper understanding of human and spatial parameters of mobility in railway station environments. A Universal Design perspective with a holistic understanding remains critical to the foundation of this research study.

Knowledge of the common complications following ARM surgery has led us to develop treatment algorithms for patients with unknown past medical and surgical history, a situation typically encountered in the adopted population. The results of investigations, indications, and rate of reoperation were assessed for adopted children with an ARM evaluated between 2014 and 2016. 56 patients (28 males) were identified. 76.8% required reoperative surgery. Mislocation of the anus outside the sphincter complex was seen in 50% of males and 39.3% of females. Anal stricture, rectal prolapse, retained vaginal septum, and a strictured vaginal introitus were also common. The reoperative surgery rate in the internationally adopted child with an ARM is high.

To investigate whether the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles increases susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, we have typed a panel of 307 female BRCA1 carriers at this locus using a PCR-based technique. The risk for ovarian cancer was 2. 11 times greater for BRCA1 carriers harbouring one or two rare HRAS1 alleles, compared to carriers with only common alleles (P = 0. 015). The magnitude of the relative risk associated with a rare HRAS1 allele was not altered by adjusting for the other known risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer (5).

In spite of appointment lead time policies set by government or clinics, the problem persists. Justification for how lead time policies are determined is lacking. This paper proposed a data-driven approach for how to best set feasible appointment target lead times given a clinic's capacity and appointment requests. The proposed approach reallocates patient visits to minimize the deviation between actual appointment lead time and a feasible target lead time. A step-by-step algorithm was presented and demonstrated for return visit (RV) and new patient (NP) types from a Pediatric clinic excluding planned visits such as well-child exam and the same day urgent appointments. The steps are: 1. Obtain appointment requests; 2. Initialize a target lead time; 3. Set up an initial schedule; 4. Check the feasibility based on appointment availability; 5. Adjust schedule backward to fill appointment slots earlier than the target; 6. Adjust schedule forward for appointments not able to be scheduled earlier or on target to the later slots; 7. Trial different target lead times until the difference between earlier and later lead time is minimized.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis. We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia. METHODS: Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. Serum hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 were investigated before and after therapy. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period. Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment. In contrast with the literature, serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin.

We recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group A (ATA) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers THY1 and pYNB3. 12 (D11S144).

The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1. Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S144-THY1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus.

However, changes at an impairment level do not always translate into functional or quality of life changes. Therefore, multiple outcome tools should be used that incorporate sufficient responsiveness to detect changes in arm/hand function, activity and participation, and quality of life of the individuals involved. This narrative review aims to assist clinicians to choose the most appropriate tools to assess the need for reconstructive surgery and to evaluate its outcomes. Our specific objectives are (1) to describe aspects to consider when choosing a measure and (2) to describe the measures advised by an international therapist consensus group established in 2007. All advised measures are appraised in terms of the underlying construct, administration, and clinical relevance to arm/hand reconstructions. Essentially there are currently no criterion standard measures to evaluate the consequences of reconstructive arm/hand surgery. However, with judicious use of available measures it is possible to ensure the questions asked or tasks completed are relevant to the surgical reconstruction (s) undertaken.

Based on these polymorphic products, a cluster analysis revealed similarities between the results of the ISSR and AFLP. All of the cultivars were clustered into two major branches; one branch contained the same four cultivars, and the other cultivars were separated into different groups in the other branch. The cluster results showed that the genetic relationships of the 17 cultivars were partly related to their morphological characteristics, particularly the flowering phase.

However, the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and polymorphism of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) gene in hypercholesterolemia is unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship and significance between polymorphisms of LDL-R gene and serum Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10 in patients with hypercholesterolemia. PCR-RFLP and direct DNA sequencing assay were employed to determine polymorphism of LDL-R gene in 900 patients with hypercholesterolemia and 400 healthy cases. ELISA was applied to assay serum concentration of IL-2 and IL-10. Blood lipid indexes were tested in all cases. Compared with the healthy controls, level of IL-2 increased significantly, while IL-10 decreased significantly (P < 0.05).

RS occurs naturally in some foods, and some may be generated in others as the results of several processing conditions. A variety of techniques have been employed to obtain structural characteristics of resistant starch such as their crystallinity, structural order, chain length distribution and conformation, helicity, and double helical structures. These structure plays an important role in determining the physiological properties of RS such as their prebiotic and hypoglycaemic properties. However, such topic on structural characterization of RS and their structure - physiological function relationship have not been reviewed in previous literatures.

The early growth response 2 gene (EGR2) is a Cys2His2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination. This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 (Egr2) knockout mice, which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation. Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain (R1) that binds the NAB transcriptional co-repressors. A combination of DNA-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations. The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity.

Co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine. These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions. Inhibition of Na(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine-induced down-regulation of NET function.

By virtue of the I domain's wide distribution in binding kinetics to ligands, it was possible to identify ligand binding kinetics as discriminator for simvastatin antagonism. In static cellular experiments, 15-25 \u03bcm simvastatin reduced adhesion by K562 cells expressing recombinant CR3 and by primary human monocytes, with an endogenous expression of this receptor. Application of force to adhering monocytes potentiated the effects of simvastatin where only a 50-100 nm concentration of the drug reduced the adhesion by 20-40% compared with untreated cells. The ability of simvastatin to target CR3 in its ligand binding - activated conformation is a novel mechanism to explain the known anti-inflammatory effects of this compound, in particular because this CR3 conformation is found in pro-inflammatory environments. Our report points to new designs of CR3 antagonists and opens new perspectives and identifies druggable receptors from characterization of the ligand binding kinetics in the presence of antagonists.", "target": "O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT O O O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O O O B-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O O B-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT B-ENT O O O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT O O B-ENT O O O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT B-ENT I-ENT O O O O O B-ENT B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O B-ENT O O B-ENT I-ENT I-ENT B-ENT O O B-ENT O B-ENT I-ENT O", "doc_id": "medmentions_27339893", "dataset": "NER"}

Characterization of these receptors provides invaluable insight into pathogenesis. However, only a subset of virulence -related TonB -dependent receptors have been currently described. Here we report the discovery of FusA, a new class of TonB -dependent receptor, which is utilized by phytopathogenic Pectobacterium spp. to obtain iron from plant ferredoxin.

The aim is to assess the association between ICHI and inflammation in European adolescents. As many as 543 adolescents (251 boys and 292 girls) from the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a cross-sectional multi-center study including 9 European countries, were measured. C-reactive protein (CRP), complement factors C3 and C4, leptin and white blood cell counts were used to compute an inflammatory score. Multilevel linear models and multilevel logistic regression were used to assess the association between ICHI and inflammation controlling by covariates. Higher ICHI was associated with a lower inflammatory score, as well as with several individual components, both in boys and girls (p < 0.01).

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Using Evolutionary Theory to Guide Mental Health Research Evolutionary approaches to medicine can shed light on the origins and etiology of disease. Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating \" normally \" (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies. Thus, the evolutionary approach suggests that psychiatry should sometimes think differently about distress and impairment. The complexity of the human brain, including normal functioning and potential for dysfunctions, has developed over evolutionary time and has been shaped by natural selection.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Bispectral pairwise interacting source analysis for identifying systems of cross-frequency interacting brain sources from electroencephalographic or magnetoencephalographic signals Brain cognitive functions arise through the coordinated activity of several brain regions, which actually form complex dynamical systems operating at multiple frequencies. These systems often consist of interacting subsystems, whose characterization is of importance for a complete understanding of the brain interaction processes. To address this issue, we present a technique, namely the bispectral pairwise interacting source analysis (biPISA), for analyzing systems of cross-frequency interacting brain sources when multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data are available. Specifically, the biPISA makes it possible to identify one or many subsystems of cross-frequency interacting sources by decomposing the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra between EEG or MEG signals, based on the assumption that interactions are pairwise. Thanks to the properties of the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra, biPISA is also robust to spurious interactions arising from mixing artifacts, i.e., volume conduction or field spread, which always affect EEG or MEG functional connectivity estimates.

Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in BRCA1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial breast cancer and the majority of familial breast/ovarian cancer. The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations, but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown. We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals. Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families. A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer. A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy.

Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months. Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency. In long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, OCT (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control.

We study geographic variation in delayed hatching of dormant eggs in natural populations of two crustaceans, Branchinella longirostris and Paralimnadia badia, that occur in temporary rock pools along a 725 km latitudinal aridity gradient in Western Australia. Consistent with bet hedging theory, populations of both species were characterised by delayed hatching under common garden conditions and hatching fractions decreased towards the drier end of the gradient where the probability of reproductive success was shown to be lower. This decrease was most pronounced in the species with the longer maturation time, presumably because it is more sensitive to the higher prevalence of short inundations. Overall, these findings illustrate that regional variation in climate can be reflected in differential investment in bet hedging and hints at a higher importance of delayed hatching to persist when the climate becomes harsher.

To carry out the ecohydrological modeling, the following information was used: bathymetry, physical and hydraulic features, and the Habitat Suitability Index for species of the Hypostomus auroguttatus. In the River2D, the Weighted Usable Areas were determined from the average long-term streamflows with percentage from 10% to 100%. Those streamflows were simulated for the later construction of optimization matrices that maximize the habitat area throughout the year. For H. auroguttatus Juvenile, higher values of Weighted Usable Area were associated with the percentage of 60% and 70% of the average long-term streamflows in October and September, respectively.

Administration of 50 mg/kg PDTC (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rate. In vehicle-treated rats, status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons.

A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle- and PDTC-treated rats following status epilepticus. In conclusion, the NF-kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex, whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal loss. These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-kappaB plays a more central role in seizure-associated neuronal damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus.

This paper focuses on the issues involved in attempting to reconstruct the mass of two early Eocene haplorhine primates, Teilhardina and Archicebus, which pose particular problems due to their small size and temporal and phylogenetic distance from extant primates. In addition to a ranking of variables from more to less useful, the effect of using models of varying taxonomic and size compositions is examined. Phylogenetic correction is also applied to the primate database. Our results indicate that the choice of variable is more critical than the choice of model. The more reliable variables are the mediolateral breadth across the femoral condyles and the area of the calcaneocuboid facet of the calcaneus. These variables suggest a body mass of 39 g (range 33-46 g) for Archicebus and 48 g (range 44-56 g) for Teilhardina.
