We now show that this dysmorphic C6 is bactericidally active and lacks an epitope that was mapped to the most carboxy-terminal part of C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed as fusion proteins in the pUEX expression system. We thus predicted that the abnormal C6 molecule might be carboxy-terminally truncated and sought a mutation in an area approximately 14% from the carboxy-terminal end of the coding sequence. By sequencing PCR-amplified products from this region, we found, in three individuals from two families, a mutation that might plausibly be responsible for the defect.

INTRODUCTION: Cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular complications, including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis. However, there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries. Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use. METHODS: We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites. Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter.

METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood.

The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02).

Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity.

The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy.

Cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory failure. The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasized. The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle.

Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no migraine attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity (P<0.001).

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection without individual genotypes: The local score approach Detecting genomic footprints of selection is an important step in the understanding of evolution. Accounting for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans increases detection power, but haplotype -based methods require individual genotypes and are not applicable on pool-sequenced samples. We propose to take advantage of the local score approach to account for linkage disequilibrium in genome scans for selection, cumulating (possibly small) signals from single markers over a genomic segment, to clearly pinpoint a selection signal. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that this approach detects selection with higher power than several state-of-the-art single-marker, windowing or haplotype -based approaches. We illustrate this on two benchmark data sets including individual genotypes, for which we obtain similar results with the local score and one haplotype -based approach. Finally, we apply the local score approach to Pool-Seq data obtained from a divergent selection experiment on behaviour in quail and obtain precise and biologically coherent selection signals: while competing methods fail to highlight any clear selection signature, our method detects several regions involving genes known to act on social responsiveness or autistic traits.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Sub-lethal effects of dietary neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on honey bee queen fecundity and colony development Many factors can negatively affect honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health including the pervasive use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides. Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food - sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Assessing the benefits of targeted drug delivery by nanocarriers: A partico/pharmacokinetic framework An in vivo kinetic framework is introduced to analyze and predict the quantitative advantage of using nanocarriers to deliver drugs, especially anticancer agents, compared to administering the same drugs in their free form. This framework recognizes three levels of kinetics. First is the particokinetics associated with deposition of nanocarriers into tissues associated with drug effect and toxicity, their residence inside those tissues, and elimination of the nanocarriers from the body. Second is the release pattern in time of free drug from the nanocarriers.

Yet, its application in oral lesions was less investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in periodontal indices following the topical use of phenytoin in chronic periodontitis.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Immunological effects of occupational exposure to lead (Review) It is well-known that occupational and environmental exposure to several factors, including benzene, heavy metals, chemicals and mineral fibers, is associated with the risk of developing a great number of diseases. Numerous studies have been carried out in order to investigate the mechanisms of toxicity of these substances, with particular regard to the possible toxic effects on the immune system. However, little is known about the influence of heavy metals, such as lead, on the immune system in human populations. Lead is a heavy metal still used in many industrial activities. Human exposure to lead can induce various biological effects depending upon the level and duration of exposure, such as toxic effects on haematological, cardiovascular, nervous and reproductive systems. Several studies demonstrated that exposure to lead is associated to toxic effects also on the immune system, thus increasing the incidence of allergy, infectious disease, autoimmunity or cancer. However, the effects of lead exposure on the human immune system are not conclusive, mostly in occupationally exposed subjects; nevertheless some immunotoxic abnormalities induced by lead have been suggested.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Vestibular ablation and a semicircular canal prosthesis affect postural stability during head turns In our study, we examined postural stability during head turns for two rhesus monkeys: one animal study contrasted normal and mild bilateral vestibular ablation and a second animal study contrasted severe bilateral vestibular ablation with and without prosthetic stimulation. The monkeys freely stood, unrestrained on a balance platform and made voluntary head turns between visual targets. To quantify each animals ' posture, motions of the head and trunk, as well as torque about the body's center of mass, were measured. In the mildly ablated animal, we observed less foretrunk sway in comparison with the normal state. When the canal prosthesis provided electric stimulation to the severely ablated animal, it showed a decrease in trunk sway during head turns. Because the rhesus monkey with severe bilateral vestibular loss exhibited a decrease in trunk sway when receiving vestibular prosthetic stimulation, we propose that the prosthetic electrical stimulation partially restored head velocity information.

BJPNF alignment and fiber diameter was dependent on fabrication rotational speed as well as solution composition. The biphasic character of these BJPNFs, which was controlled via the rotational speed of fabrication, was confirmed at the individual nanofiber scale using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and at the bulk, macro-scale using attenuated total reflectance - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Biphasic character was also demonstrated at the functional level via differing affinities on either side of the BJPNF for cell attachment.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Chemisorption of Perfluorooctanoic Acid on Powdered Activated Carbon Initiated by Persulfate in Aqueous Solution Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a perfluorocarboxylic acid that is difficult to treat by most conventional methods. As a result, it is often removed from solution by adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC), followed by incineration of the spent carbon. To provide a new approach for treatment, PFOA was exposed to sulfate radicals (SO4(-•)) produced by thermolysis of persulfate (S2O8(2-)) in the presence of PAC. Under acidic conditions, thermal activation of persulfate resulted in transformation of PFOA to shorter-chain-length perfluorinated compounds, as previously reported. However, when thermolysis of persulfate occurred under circumneutral pH conditions in the presence of PAC, a new removal pathway for PFOA was observed. Under these conditions, the removal of PFOA was attributable to chemisorption, a process in which PAC catalyzed persulfate decomposition and reacted with the transformation products to produce covalently bound PFOA.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Identification of mineral - binding peptides that discriminate between chalcopyrite and enargite Innovative approaches to the separation of minerals and subsequent extraction of metals are imperative owing to the increasing mineralogical complexity of ore deposits that are difficult or even impossible to separate into slurries or solutions containing only the minerals or metals of interest. Low recovery of metal is typical for these complex deposits leading to significant losses to tailings. In addition, the minerals often contain impurities, some toxic, which are difficult and costly to control or manage during the processing of a concentrate or other mineral product. One example of this complex situation is the significant economic and environmental costs associated with diluting and processing copper concentrates containing arsenic (in the form of the mineral enargite, Cu3 AsS4) in the production of pure copper. To overcome these separation problems, we have utilized phage display to identify peptides that demonstrate selective recognition of enargite and the arsenic - free copper sulfide, chalcopyrite.

However, current staging guidelines for superficially invasive cancers do not acknowledge the variability in type and extent of lamina propria invasion in papillary urothelial carcinomas (PUC), and historically proposed substaging systems showed either high inter-observer variation or limited value in predicting patient outcomes. Herein we reappraise pT1 PUC substaging, aiming to identify a novel scheme which is reproducible and prognostically meaningful. Stage pT1 PUC diagnosed during years 1999-2015 were retrospectively reviewed and characterized as focal invasion confined to papillary stalk, focal invasion of tumor base, or extensive invasion of tumor base.

In addition, the phenotypic and genetic variation preserved in tomato landraces represents a means to understand the genetic basis of traits related to health and organoleptic aspects and improve them in modern varieties. To establish a framework for this approach, we studied the content of several metabolites in a panel of Italian tomato landraces categorized into three broad fruit type classes (flattened / ribbed, pear / oxheart, round / elongate). Three modern hybrids, corresponding to the three fruit shape typologies, were included as reference. Red ripe fruits were morphologically characterized and biochemically analyzed for their content in glycoalkaloids, phenols, amino acids, and Amadori products. The round / elongate types showed a higher content in glycoalkaloids, whereas flattened types had higher levels of phenolic compounds.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Potentiation of LPS - Induced Apoptotic Cell Death in Human Hepatoma HepG2 Cells by Aspirin via ROS and Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Protection by N-Acetyl Cysteine Cytotoxicity and inflammation - associated toxic responses have been observed to be induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in vitro and in vivo respectively. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, has been reported to be beneficial in inflammation - associated diseases like cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Their precise molecular mechanisms, however, are not clearly understood. Our previous studies on aspirin treated HepG2 cells strongly suggest cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

Analysis of genetically labeled RGCs revealed that this regrowth can be target specific: RGC axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided targets incorrect for their function.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Palmitoyl Glycol Chitosan Micelles for Corneal Delivery of Cyclosporine Different substitution degrees of palmitoyl glycol chitosan (PGC), prepared according to the literature, were used to obtain polymeric micelles that have been assessed in comparison with Pluronic F127 micelles as possible carriers for poorly soluble drugs, such as cyclosporine A. Both PGC and Pluronic micelles were studied for their interactions with cell culture substrates. The least substituted and most hydrophilic derivative, PGC21 (approximately 5% substitution), showed a strong association with cyclosporine, more than tripling the colloidal concentration with respect to the saturated solution.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Mass spectrometric analysis of protein - ligand interactions The interactions of small molecules with proteins (protein - ligand interactions) mediate various biological phenomena including signal transduction and protein transcription and translation. Synthetic compounds such as drugs can also bind to target proteins, leading to the inhibition of protein - ligand interactions. These interactions typically accompany association - dissociation equilibrium according to the free energy difference between free and bound states; therefore, the quantitative biophysical analysis of the interactions, which uncovers the stoichiometry and dissociation constant, is important for understanding biological reactions as well as for rational drug development. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been used to determine the precise molecular masses of molecules. Recent advancements in MS enable us to determine the molecular masses of protein - ligand complexes without disrupting the non-covalent interactions through the gentle desolvation of the complexes by increasing the vacuum pressure of a chamber in a mass spectrometer.

Its infection leads to an acute illness accompanied by long-lasting arthralgia. To date, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines against infection with MAYV and resources for the prevention or treatment of other alphaviruses are very limited. MAYV has served as a model to study the antiviral potential of several substances on alphavirus replication. In this work we evaluated the antiviral effect of seven new derivatives of thieno[2,3-b]pyridine against MAYV replication in a mammalian cell line. All derivatives were able to reduce viral production effectively at concentrations that were non-toxic for Vero cells. Molecular modeling assays predicted low toxicity risk and good oral bioavailability of the substances in humans.

Moreover, both rates and risk factors for revision are variable and inconsistent within the literature. To determine the rate of revision surgery after ACL reconstruction in a large cohort of patients, to assess the influence of patient characteristics on the odds of revision, and to compare revision rates between active-duty military members and non-active-duty beneficiaries.

Extravasation from circulation at the tumor site is a critical step in this sequence since it regulates how much of the drug accumulates in the tumor. Despite its importance in determining outcomes, extravasation from circulation remains a \"black box.\" The objective of this study is to develop predictive tools for optimization of drug delivery systems. By comparing pharmacokinetics of liposomal doxorubicin in tumor -free and tumor bearing mice we quantitatively assess the rate constants for distribution, elimination, and tumor accumulation. We then relate these rate constants to the tumor -type and drug delivery system. We compare tumor accumulation in three tumor types and show a 10-fold difference between a colorectal adenocarcinoma and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

To date, the molecular features of prostate tumors occurring in HOXB13 G84E carriers have not been studied in a large cohort of patients.

Immunostaining for HOXB13, PTEN, ERG, p53 and SPINK1 as well as RNA in situ hybridization for ETV1 / 4 / 5 were performed using genetically validated assays.

However, although device success rates are generally high, patient outcomes are sometimes compromised due to device -related problems such as insufficient integration, local tissue inflammation, and infection. Many different types of surface coatings have been developed to address these shortcomings, including those that incorporate therapeutic agents to provide localized delivery to the surgical site. While these coatings hold enormous potential for improving device function, the list of requirements that an ideal combination coating must fulfill is extensive, and no single coating system today simultaneously addresses all of the criteria.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> The Role of Simulation in Surgical Education The current healthcare environment demands optimization of patient outcomes in addition to maximal cost efficiency. Restrictions on resident work hours have placed limitations on the amount of time that trainee physicians can spend on patient care. For the surgery resident, the consequence is less time spent in the operating room under the supervision of a senior surgeon, the cornerstone of Halsted's approach to resident surgeon education. The use of simulation in graduate medical education has gained significant traction as a way to provide trainees with exposure to various techniques and procedures before use on the general patient population. This article describes simulation - based education with particular attention to surgical education.

One possibility to overcome this problem might be found in the application of mucoadhesive dosage forms like gastrointestinal wafers.

One suggested solution might be the combination of gastrointestinal wafers and expanding systems. Such a combination requires thin and elastic wafers which are further characterized by an unidirectional drug release.

Within a larger global phylogenomic framework, Bayesian modelling suggested that this NZ clade emerged in the late 2000s, with a probable origin in swine from Western Europe. Elucidating the factors responsible for the incursion and spread of LA-MRSA in geographically distant regions, such as NZ, provides important insights into global pathways of S. aureus transmission, and will inform strategies to control importation and spread.", "target": "isolates|C1764827 ; New Zealand|C0027978 ; NZ|C0027978 ; geographically isolated country|C0454664 ; economy|C0870462 ; livestock|C2936506 ; farming|C0001829 ; NZ|C0027978 ; CC398|C1522642 ; MRSA|C1265292 ; collection|C0010995 ; global datasets|C0150098 ; CC398|C1522642 ; MRSA|C1265292 ; CC398|C1522642 ; methicillin-susceptible S. aureus|C1635274 ; sporadic|C0205422 ; incursions|C1304680 ; CC398|C1522642 ; MRSA|C1265292 ; NZ|C0027978 ; spread|C0332261 ; swine|C0039005 ; clade|C1003859 ; LA-MRSA|C1265292 ; lineage|C1881379 ; global|C2348867 ; Bayesian modelling|C0242196 ; NZ|C0027978 ; clade|C1003859 ; origin|C0439659 ; swine|C0039005 ; Western Europe|C0043129 ; factors|C1521761 ; incursion|C1304680 ; spread|C0332261 ; LA-MRSA|C1265292 ; geographically distant regions|C0017446 ; NZ|C0027978 ; global|C2348867 ; S. aureus|C0038172 ; transmission|C1521797 ; strategies|C0679716 ; spread|C0332261", "doc_id": "medmentions_28348878", "dataset": "medmentions"}

The method requires a pathologist to differentiate healthy tissue from tumor tissue, and basic tissue culture skills. The protocol can be used with cells derived from both fresh and cryopreserved tissue samples.

We collected 6,407 host-seeking ticks from two regions and 1,598 larvae obtained from 32 engorged female ticks and examined them to elucidate transovarial transmission. In addition, we examined whole blood samples from 190 wild boars and 276 sika deer, as well as sera from 120 wild raccoons.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Using Evolutionary Theory to Guide Mental Health Research Evolutionary approaches to medicine can shed light on the origins and etiology of disease. Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating \" normally \" (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies. Thus, the evolutionary approach suggests that psychiatry should sometimes think differently about distress and impairment. The complexity of the human brain, including normal functioning and potential for dysfunctions, has developed over evolutionary time and has been shaped by natural selection.

However, little information is available about microbial diversity in the semi-arid Caatinga, which represents a unique biome that extends to about 11% of the Brazilian territory and is home to extraordinary diversity and high endemism level of species. In this study, we characterized the diversity of microbial genes associated with biomass conversion (carbohydrate-active enzymes, or so-called CAZYmes) in soil and freshwater of the Caatinga. Our results showed distinct CAZYme profiles in the soil and freshwater samples.

In the case of pathogenic organisms, these approaches have allowed the determination of drug targets by means of resistance selection followed by genome sequencing.

Search strings were developed to identify publications from electronic databases to February 2015. Abstracts of 4255 papers identified were reviewed by three reviewers to determine whether the entire article was likely to contain relevant information.

Many risk factors are inter-related and study designs often do not enable differentiation between cause and consequence of infection. Despite differences in study design and location, some risk factors are consistently identified, e.g. herd size, bTB history, presence of infected wildlife, whereas the evidence for others is less consistent and coherent, e.g. nutrition, local cattle movements.

In the long-term, progressive stabilization of drug resistant epilepsy associated with non-convulsive status epilepticus, focal seizures with motor and autonomic features, and eyelid myoclonia were noticed. Epilepsy onset in adolescence (3 patients) was accompanied by a milder developmental course, dyscognitive seizures and non-convulsive status epilepticus, and no cognitive decline. Only three older patients became seizure free (>5 years) We found statistically significant correlations between age at epilepsy onset and cognitive level.

This was a qualitative study based on individual telephone interviews, analysed by means of qualitative content analysis and inspired by interpretive description. 17 participants were recruited from two different-sized Danish hospitals and identified by applying a purposeful sample strategy. The main theme expressed the women's overall experience with the rebozo: \"Joined movements in a harmless effort towards a natural birth \". The women experienced that the technique created bodily sensations, which reduced their pain, and furthermore they expressed that it interrelated the labour process and produced mutual involvement and psychological support from the midwife and the women's partner. The rebozo technique was in most situations carried out because the midwife suspected a foetus malposition. The experiences of the rebozo technique were overall positive and both of a physical and psychological nature. The results indicate that health professionals should view rebozo as an easy accessible clinical tool with high user acceptance and possible positive psychological and clinical implications.

Four types of feedback were given: (1) special haptic feedback, involving actively following the motions of the sliders manipulated by two confederates, (2) haptic feedback resulting from passive motion, (3) veridical visual feedback, and (4) enhanced visual feedback. Both with respect to amplitude assimilation effects, correlations and standard deviation of relative phase, the results showed that enhanced visual feedback did not facilitate bipedal independence, but haptic feedback with active movement did.

This study examined the impact of the four stages of internalized stigma on recovery orientation and assessed cognitive insight as a moderator. Data from a community sample of adults with serious mental illness (N = 268) were collected through structured interviews. Regression -based analyses were used to examine the main effects of internalized stigma on recovery orientation and the moderating effect of cognitive insight. Applying stigmatizing beliefs to oneself and the related decrement in self-esteem each predicted decreased recovery orientation. Cognitive insight moderated the effect of self-application of stigmatizing beliefs on recovery orientation. Increasing cognitive insight by fostering flexibility in self-cognitions may help reduce internalized stigma. Interventions may also benefit from addressing the emotional component of internalized stigma, such as feelings of shame.

To identify miRNAs associated with castration resistance, we performed miRNA microarray analysis comparing castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with androgen dependent prostate cancer (ADPC). We identified common underexpression of miR-4638-5p in CRPC compared to ADPC samples, which were further confirmed by quantitative PCR analysis. The role of miR-4638-5p in prostate cancer androgen-independent growth has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. We also identified Kidins220 as a target gene directly regulated by miR-4638-5p and shRNA -mediated knockdown of Kidins220 phenocopied miR-4638-5p restoration.

In the current study, the expression of kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A), a member of kinesin superfamily, was investigated in breast cancer using immunohistochemistry, and its effect on breast cancer prognosis was examined. KIF18A expression level was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.047).

We amplified DNA molecules in a one-reaction system without considering their particular sequences and lengths (overall amplification) by using PCR -based enrichment. We then modified PCR conditions to verify the effect of denaturation temperature on DNA amplification on various lengths of DNA (selective overall amplification).

By presenting two stimulus components simultaneously, flickering at different temporal frequencies (frequency tagging) while measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials, we can assess responses to the individual components, including direct measurements of suppression on each other, and various nonlinear responses to their combination found at intermodulation frequencies. The result is a rather rich dataset of frequencies at which responses can be found. We presented pairs of sinusoidal gratings at different temporal frequencies, forming plaid patterns that were \" coherent \" (looking like a checkerboar d) and \" noncoherent \" (looking like a pair of transparently overlaid gratings), and found clear intermodulation responses to compound stimuli, indicating nonlinear summation. This might have been attributed to cross-orientation suppression except that the pattern of intermodulation responses differed for coherent and noncoherent patterns, whereas the effects of suppression (measured at the component frequencies) did not.

The wear traces indicate that tools were used for harvesting near - ripe semi- green wild cereals, shortly before grains are ripe and disperse naturally. The studied tools were not used intensively, and they reflect two harvesting modes: flint knives held by hand and inserts hafted in a handle.

Presently, there is no other technology available, which is either superior or even comparable to the conventional CMP. The present study was designed to fabricate ocular prosthesis using computer aided design (CAD) and rapid manufacturing (RM) technology and to compare it with custom made prosthesis (CMP). The ocular prosthesis prepared by CAD was compared with conventional CMP in terms of time taken for fabrication, weight, cosmesis, comfort, and motility. Two eyes of two patients were included. Computerized tomography scan of wax model of socket was converted into three dimensional format using Materialize Interactive Medical Image Control System (MIMICS) software and further refined.

The operational taxonomic unit richness of the bacterial community ranged from 3664 to 5899, and the diversity indices, including Chao1, Shannon-Wiener, and Faith's phylogenetic diversity ranged from 7751 to 15 204, 7.386 to 8.327, and 415.77 to 679.11, respectively. The 2 most dominant phyla in the soil samples were Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The richness and diversity of the bacterial community were positively correlated with soil pH.

To enter clinical use, and even for publication purposes, novel and existing 32R methods have to be rigorously validated. The performance of a 32R method can be estimated by comparing it to an accurate reference or gold standard method (usually based on fiducial markers) on the same set of images (gold standard dataset).

Currently, very few such datasets exist and only one contains images of multiple patients acquired during a procedure. To encourage the creation of gold standard 32R datasets, we propose an automatic framework. The framework is based on rigid registration of fiducial markers.

Thus, it is an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics. While the structural basis of core particle (CP) inhibitors is largely understood, their structural impact on the proteasome holoenzyme remains entirely elusive. Here, we determined the structure of the 26S proteasome with and without the inhibitor Oprozomib. Drug binding modifies the energy landscape of conformational motion in the proteasome regulatory particle (RP). Structurally, the energy barrier created by Oprozomib triggers a long-range allosteric regulation, resulting in the stabilization of a non-productive state. Thereby, the chemical drug-binding signal is converted, propagated and amplified into structural changes over a distance of more than 150 Å from the proteolytic site to the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10. The direct visualization of changes in conformational dynamics upon drug binding allows new ways to screen and develop future allosteric proteasome inhibitors.", "target": "Long-range|C0392762 ; allosteric regulation|C0002145 ; human 26S proteasome|C0286330 ; 20S proteasome|C0208355 ; targeting|C1521840 ; cancer drugs|C0003392 ; proteasome|C0208355 ; holoenzyme|C0282109 ; non-lysosomal protease|C0030940 ; proteolytic activity|C0597304 ; essential|C0205224 ; cellular homeostasis|C2244223 ; attractive|C2346874 ; target|C1521840 ; development|C1527148 ; chemotherapeutics|C0003392 ; basis|C1527178 ; core particle (CP) inhibitors|C0014432 ; impact|C4049986 ; proteasome|C0208355 ; holoenzyme|C0282109 ; 26S proteasome|C0286330 ; inhibitor|C0014432 ; Oprozomib|C2984209 ; Drug binding|C0678749 ; modifies|C0392747 ; landscape|C0870781 ; conformational motion|C1148560 ; proteasome|C0208355 ; regulatory particle|C1325623 ; RP|C1325623 ; energy barrier|C1254365 ; Oprozomib|C2984209 ; triggers|C0032930 ; long-range|C0392762 ; allosteric regulation|C0002145 ; stabilization|C1292828 ; chemical drug-binding|C0678749 ; signal|C1710082 ; converted|C0439836 ; propagated|C1254366 ; amplified|C1521871 ; structural|C0678594 ; changes|C0392747 ; distance|C1292828 ; proteolytic site|C1513411 ; ubiquitin receptor|C0769158 ; Rpn10|C1869537 ; direct visualization|C3846514 ; changes|C0392747 ; conformational dynamics|C1148560 ; drug binding|C0678749 ; screen|C0220908 ; allosteric|C0002145 ; proteasome inhibitors|C1443643", "doc_id": "medmentions_28541292", "dataset": "medmentions"}

A conceptual model that quantifies the relationships and interactions among parental socioeconomic status, family food security level, child's food intake and certain aspects of parental feeding behaviour is presented using the structural equation modeling (SEM) concept. Structural models are analysed in terms of the direct and indirect connections among latent and measurement variables that lead to the child weight indicator. To illustrate the accuracy, fit, reliability and validity of the introduced framework, real data collected from 630 families from Urumqi (Xinjiang, China) were considered. The framework includes two categories of data comprising the normal body mass index (BMI) range and obesity data. The comparison analysis between two models provides some evidence that in obesity modeling, obesity data must be extracted from the dataset and analysis must be done separately from the normal BMI range.

We report two studies that investigate how ingroup favoritism evolves over time in social interaction. The levels of ingroup favoritism were affected by categorization and inequality, and the level of ingroup favoritism changed over time, increasing or decreasing depending on the nature of the initial intergroup structure.

Biostimulation with root exudates, low molecular weight organic acids, of J. acutus did not improve BPA - degradation rates. Furthermore, the endophytic bacterial community of J. acutus was isolated and characterized. Many strains were found to possess increased tolerance to metals such as Zn, Ni, Pb and Cd. Moreover, several endophytic bacterial strains tolerated and even used BPA and/or two antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole) as a sole carbon source. Our results demonstrate that the cultivable bacterial endophytic community of J. acutus is able to use organic contaminants as carbon sources, tolerates metals and is equipped with plant-growth promoting traits.

Valid and comparable data on the population burden of sepsis constitute an essential resource for guiding health policy and resource allocation.

The objective of this narrative review is to assess how sepsis incidence and mortality can be estimated, providing examples on how it has been done so far in medical literature and discussing its possible biases.

The serratus anterior is portrayed as a homogeneous muscle in textbooks and during functional activities and rehabilitation exercises. It is unclear whether the serratus anterior is composed of subdivisions with distinctive morphology and functions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the serratus anterior could be subdivided into different structural parts on the basis of its segmental architectural parameters. Eight formalin - embalmed serratus anterior muscles were dissected and the attachments of each fascicle documented. Orientation and size of each fascicle were measured and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) calculated. Three subdivisions of the serratus anterior were identified. A new finding was the discovery of two distinctive fascicles attached to the superior and inferior aspects of rib 2. The rib 2 inferior fascicle had the largest PCSA (mean 1.6 cm(2)) and attached, with the rib 3 fascicle, along the medial border of the scapula to form the middle division.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Activation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger in isolated cardiomyocytes through β-Raf dependent pathways. Role of Thr(653) of the cytosolic tail The mammalian Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a ubiquitous plasma membrane protein that is a key regulator of intracellular pH in isolated cardiomyocytes. A 500 amino acid membrane domain removes protons and is regulated by a 315 amino acid cytosolic domain. In the myocardium, aberrant regulation of NHE1 contributes to ischemia reperfusion damage and to heart hypertrophy. We examined mechanisms of regulation of NHE1 in the myocardium by endothelin and β-Raf. Endothelin stimulated NHE1 activity and activated Erk-dependent pathways. Inhibition of β-Raf reduced NHE1 activity and Erk-pathway activation. We demonstrated that myocardial β-Raf binds to the C-terminal 182 amino acids of the NHE1 protein and that β-Raf is associated with NHE1 in intact cardiomyocytes.

The recovery of Ca(2+) -dependent signal transduction on motor end plates (MEPs) and innervated muscle may directly reflect nerve regeneration following peripheral nerve injury.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> How do different delivery schedules of tailored web-based physical activity advice for breast cancer survivors influence intervention use and efficacy? The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of differing delivery schedules of computer-tailored physical activity modules on engagement and physical activity behaviour change in a web-based intervention targeting breast cancer survivors. Insufficiently active breast cancer survivors (n = 492) were randomly assigned to receive one of the following intervention schedules over 12 weeks: a three- module intervention delivered monthly, a three-module intervention delivered weekly or a single module intervention. Engagement with the website (number of logins, time on site, modules viewed, action plans completed) was measured using tracking software. Other outcomes (website acceptability, physical activity behaviour) were assessed using online surveys.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> The role of Indonesian patients' health behaviors in delaying the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma With an estimated 13,000 newly diagnosed patients per year, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common types of cancer in males in Indonesia. Moreover, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease. This study aimed to explore the health behaviors of patients diagnosed with NPC and the possible causes of patient delay in NPC diagnosis. A qualitative research method was used to gain better insight into patient behaviors. Twelve patients were interviewed using semi-structured interview guidelines. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed according to a standard content analysis framework. Most patients had limited knowledge regarding NPC and its causes. Fifty percent of the patients had a delay of six months from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Methylation dynamics during folliculogenesis and early embryo development in sheep Genome -wide DNA methylation reprogramming occurs during mammalian gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. Post - fertilization demethylation of paternal and maternal genomes is considered to occur by an active and passive mechanism respectively, in most mammals but sheep; in this species no loss of methylation was observed in either pronucleus. Post - fertilization reprogramming relies on methylating and demethylating enzymes and co-factors that are stored during oocyte growth, concurrently with the re-methylation of the oocyte itself. The crucial remodelling of the oocyte epigenetic baggage often overlaps with potential interfering events such as exposure to assisted reproduction technologies or environmental changes. Here, we report a temporal analysis of methylation dynamics during folliculogenesis and early embryo development in sheep.

The C9orf72 protein, predicted to be a DENN-family protein, is reduced in ALS and FTD, but its functions remain poorly understood. Using a 3110043O21Rik / C9orf72 knockout mouse model, as well as cellular analysis, we have found that loss of C9orf72 causes alterations in the signaling states of central autophagy regulators. In particular, C9orf72 depletion leads to reduced activity of MTOR, a negative regulator of macroautophagy / autophagy, and concomitantly increased TFEB levels and nuclear translocation. Consistent with these alterations, cells exhibit enlarged lysosomal compartments and enhanced autophagic flux. Loss of the C9orf72 interaction partner SMCR8 results in similar phenotypes.

However, no correlation was observed between IGFBP5 expression and age, menopause or the presence of lymph node metastasis (p > 0.05).

We used a multi-state lifetable Markov model to examine the potential impact of an additional 20% tax on SSBs on total lifetime productivity in the paid and unpaid sectors of the economy. The study population consisted of Australians aged 20 years or older in 2010, whose health and other relevant outcomes were modelled over their remaining lifetime.

It also inhibits the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This study aimed to evaluate the osthole suppressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease effects in oleic acid (OA)- induced hepatic steatosis and if it can modulate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. FL83B cell s were pretreated with OA (250μΜ) for 24h, and then added different concentrations of osthole (3-100μM) for 24h. Subsequently, lipolysis and transcription factors of adipogenesis and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase proteins were measured.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> A fission yeast cell-based system for multidrug resistant HIV-1 proteases HIV-1 protease (PR) is an essential enzyme for viral production. Thus, PR inhibitors (PIs) are the most effective class of anti-HIV drugs. However, the main challenge to the successful use of PI drugs in patient treatment is the emergence of multidrug resistant PRs (mdrPRs). This study aimed to develop a fission yeast cell-based system for rapid testing of new PIs that combat mdrPRs. Three mdrPRs were isolated from HIV-infected patients that carried seven (M7PR), ten (M10PR) and eleven (M11PR) PR gene mutations, respectively. They were cloned and expressed in fission yeast under an inducible promoter to allow the measurement of PR -specific proteolysis and drug resistance. The results showed that all three mdrPRs maintained their abilities to proteolyze HIV viral substrates (MA ↓ CA and p6) and to confer drug resistance.

Our understanding of the role of the dorsal pathway, in particular, has greatly evolved within the framework of the two-pathway hypothesis since its original conception. Here, we present a comparative review of the primate dorsal pathway in humans and monkeys based on electrophysiological, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and neuroanatomical studies. We consider similarities and differences across species in terms of the topographic representation of visual space; specificity for eye, reaching, or grasping movements; multi-modal response properties; and the representation of objects and tools.

RESULTS All 3 H9N2 viruses showed a preference for both the avian - and human-like receptors, and they replicated well in MDCK and A549 cells. All H9N2 viruses were non-pathogenic to mini-pigs and were detected in the trachea and lung tissues.

Therefore, metabolite determination at the whole cell level may be insufficient for interpretation of the functional significance of cellular compounds. To investigate the cold - induced metabolite dynamics at the level of individual sub-cellular compartments, an integrative platform was developed that combines quantitative metabolite profiling by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with the non-aqueous fractionation technique allowing separation of cytosol, vacuole and the plastidial compartment. Two mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana representing antipodes in the diversion of carbohydrate metabolism between sucrose and starch were compared to Col-0 wildtype before and after cold acclimation to investigate interactions of cold acclimation with subcellular re-programming of metabolism.

Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were added to increase the flexibility of the polymer and the conductivity of the electrode. An ECG electrode patch was fabricated by integrating the electrodes with an adhesive polydimethylsiloxane (aPDMS) layer.

The polymer electrodes combined with the measurement system were successfully applied in wireless, long-term recording of ECG signals. An eleven- day continuous test showed that the ECG signal did not degrade over time.

We randomized four primary care sites to training or wait-list conditions; PCPs at wait-list sites were trained after reassessment.

Patients rated PCPs significantly higher after training on a scale encompassing partnership issues. Breakdowns showed lower partnership scores for those with trauma or posttraumatic stress symptoms.

The enhanced TGFβ activation in mice treated with LPS and TUDCA correlated with both an increase in TGFβ3 transcript in mouse brain and an increase in TGFβ3 immunoreactivity in microglia / macrophages, endothelial cells, and neurons.

Areas covered: Herein, the authors summarize the current knowledge of CAR T-cell therapy. Accordingly, they focus on its antigen - binding domain, discuss key considerations for selecting an optimal single-chain variable fragment (scFv) when designing a CAR, and suggest potential directions aimed at developing the next-generation CARs. Expert opinion: The extracellular region of CARs can play a decisive role in their safety and efficacy. Instead of directly translating an available therapeutic mAb to a scFv-based CAR construct, the authors suggest that various CAR - displayed scFvs with different affinity, specificity and binding epitopes against an individual target molecule should be generated and evaluated side-by-side.

In neurons of the hippocampus, their cargo includes proteins that mediate several pivotal processes, including differentiation and synaptic plasticity.

We also have tested the functionally motivated hypothesis that these organelles are synaptically enriched.

The identification of subjects at high risk for SCD is of great importance as the prevention of many of these events would be possible with the treatment of underlying cardiac diseases and the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD). However, the current selection of patients for ICD therapy is based solely on left ventricular ejection fraction, and thus a substantial portion of patients at high risk does not qualify for the therapy.

For instance it inhibits photosynthesis through stomatal limitation, causes excessive accumulation of sodium and chloride in chloroplasts, and disturbs chloroplast potassium homeostasis. Most research on salt stress has focused primarily on cytosolic ion homeostasis with few studies of how salt stress affects chloroplast ion homeostasis. This review asks the question whether membrane-transport processes and ionic relations are differentially regulated between glycophyte and halophyte chloroplasts and whether this contributes to the superior salt tolerance of halophytes. The available literature indicates that halophytes can overcome stomatal limitation by switching to CO2 concentrating mechanisms and increasing the number of chloroplasts per cell under saline conditions. Furthermore, salt entry into the chloroplast stroma may be critical for grana formation and photosystem II activity in halophytes but not in glycophytes.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Antigen Masking During Fixation and Embedding, Dissected Antigen masking in routinely processed tissue is a poorly understood process caused by multiple factors. We sought to dissect the effect on antigenicity of each step of processing by using frozen sections as proxies of the whole tissue. An equivalent extent of antigen masking occurs across variable fixation times at room temperature. Most antigens benefit from longer fixation times (>24 hr) for optimal detection after antigen retrieval (AR; for example, Ki-67, bcl-2, ER). The transfer to a graded alcohol series results in an enhanced staining effect, reproduced by treating the sections with detergents, possibly because of a better access of the polymeric immunohistochemical detection system to tissue structures.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Brood size constrains the development of endothermy in blue tits Altricial birds are unable to maintain body temperature when exposed to low ambient temperatures during the first days after hatching. Thermoregulatory capacity begins to form as postnatal development progresses, and eventually nestlings become homeothermic. Several factors may influence this development at both the level of the individual and the level of the whole brood, but to our knowledge no studies have focused on the effect of brood size per se on the development of endothermy in individual nestlings. We performed cooling experiments on blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings in the field, to study how different experimental brood sizes affected the development of endothermy in individual nestlings and the thermal environment experienced by the whole brood in the nest.

The present paper aims to determine the prevalence of coping strategies for three everyday problems in children, while examining sociodemographic variables, context variables, and teacher assessment. The sample is composed of 7,058 school children aged between 8 and 13 years old. Results show a higher prevalence of the Active Solution strategy at home and in school contexts compared with the health area, where the Active Solution is the least prevalent strategy, and Concealing the Problem the most widely used, followed by Passivity. Other highly prevalent strategies in the school context include Search for Information, Emotion, and Social Support. In general, regardless of the context, Behavioural Avoidance and Passivity are the least prevalent strategies, whereas Active Solution is the most prevalent one, followed by Emotion. The last two- Active Solution and Emotion - are part of two main coping styles suggested in a number of studies on which these results are based, which will be compared and discussed in this study.

Moreover, pre-treatment with naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, only partially inhibited the effects of tebanicline in formalin and tail-pressure tests. Tebanicline produced antinociception in persistent chemical (formalin), acute thermal (hot-plate, but not tail-flick) and mechanical (tail-pressure) pain states.

The aim of this study was to examine whether an age-related influence on joint mobility can be detected in the absence of diseases. Five young (Ø 2.0 years) and five old (Ø 10.4 years) healthy and sound Beagle dogs were measured during locomotion on a treadmill by computer-assisted gait analysis. Angles of the shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle and tarsal joints were analyzed, including joint angle progression curves, minimum and maximum joint angles and range of motion (ROM). The old group showed a smaller maximum joint angle (p = 0.037) and ROM (p = 0.037) of the carpal joint and similar tendencies in the shoulder, elbow and carpal joint. The descriptive analysis of the progression curves revealed less flexion and extension of the joints of the forelimb.

Many metabolic pathways are active during seed development. Oil (triacylglycerols (TAGs)) accumulates in oil bodies distributed in the endosperm cells of tung tree seeds. The relationship between oil bodies and oil content during tung tree seed development was analyzed using ultrastructural observations, which confirmed that oil accumulation was correlated with the volumes and numbers of oil bodies in the endosperm cells during three different developmental stages. For a deeper understanding of seed development, we carried out proteomic analyses. At least 144 proteins were differentially expressed during three different developmental stages.

Current reforms aim to improve the efficiency of mental health care systems by increasing service integration in communities and strengthening primary mental health care. In this context, mental health care professionals (MHPs) are increasingly required to work on interdisciplinary teams in a variety of settings. Little is known, however, about the profiles of MHPs in relation to their perceived work role performance. MHPs in Quebec (N = 315) from four local service networks completed a self-administered questionnaire eliciting information on individual and team characteristics, as well as team processes and states. Profiles of MHPs were created using a two-step cluster analysis. Five profiles were generated.

Previous genetic studies indicated that CDC-25.2 is specifically required for binucleations at the L1 larval stage and is repressed before endoreduplications. Furthermore, LIN-23, the C. elegans β-TrCP ortholog, appears to function as a repressor of CDC-25.2 to prevent excess intestinal divisions.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> Family close but friends closer: exploring social support and resilience in older spousal dementia carers Spousal dementia carers have unique support needs; they are likely to disengage from their existing social networks as they need to devote more time to caring as the disease progresses. Previously we showed that support resources can facilitate resilience in carers, but the relationship is complex and varies by relationship type. The current paper aims to explore social support as a key component of resilience to identify the availability, function and perceived functional aspects of support provided to older spousal dementia carers. We conducted 23 in-depth qualitative interviews with spousal carers from two carer support groups and a care home in North West England. Family and friends served a wide range of functions but were equally available to resilient and non-resilient participants. Family support was perceived as unhelpful if it created feelings of over-dependence. Participants were less likely to resist involvement of grandchildren due to their relatively narrow and low-level support functions.

A case study of two national approaches Objective Despite being a healthy country by international standards, Australia has a growing and serious burden from chronic diseases. There have been several national efforts to tackle this problem, but despite some important advances much more needs to be done. From the viewpoint of diverse stakeholders, the present study examined two approaches to controlling chronic disease in Australia: (1) the 2005 National Chronic Disease Strategy (NCDS); and (2) the 2008 National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health (NPAPH).Methods Individual and small group semistructured interviews were undertaken with 29 leaders across Australia, reflecting a diverse cross-section of senior public health managers and program implementation staff from state and territory health departments, as well as academics, thought leaders and public health advocates. A grounded theory approach was used to generate themes relevant to the research.Results There is general support for national approaches to the prevention of chronic disease. The NCDS was viewed as necessary and useful for national coordination, setting a common agenda and serving as an anchor to align jurisdictional priorities and action.

Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia characterized by a progressive band-like recession of the frontotemporal hairline and frequent loss of the eyebrows. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women. Coexistence of FFA and vitiligo is rarely reported in the literature. We retrospectively studied 20 cases diagnosed with FFA in a 14- month period in our Department. Among them, there were 2 cases, a 72-year-old woman and a 48-year-old man, who developed FFA on preexisting vitiligo of the forehead. Anatomical colocalization of the two dermatoses supports the notion that a causal link may exist and their association may not be coincidental.

{"task": "EL", "input": "<EL> DNA barcoding and phylogenetic relationships of Ardeidae (Aves: Ciconiiformes) The avian family Ardeidae comprises long-legged freshwater and coastal birds. There has been considerable disagreement concerning the intrafamilial relationships of Ardeidae. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was used as a marker for the identification and phylogenetic analysis of avian species. In the present study, we analyzed the COI barcodes of 32 species from 17 genera belonging to the family Ardeidae.

She was started on a prednisone taper and a 3 day course of levaquin. Her symptoms improved dramatically. She was discharged on flovent instead of budesonide.
